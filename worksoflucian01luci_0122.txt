DIALOGUE XVIII.

NEPTUNE AND TnntNEP.E1D5.

NEPTUNE.

HENCEFORTH let this Streight, where the † girl was lost, be called
stom her, the Hellespont. Do you, Nereids, carry the body to Troy, to

be buried by her countrywomen.

AMPHITRITE.
Rather, Neptune, let us bury it in the sea that bears her name: we fin-

cerely pity her ; for dreadful are the evils she has suffered from her mother-

in-laxv. .
N E P T U N E.

That, Amphitrite, must not be, nor will it be decent to leave her on the
sand3'but, as I said before, let her be buried at Chersonesus. One com-
fort yet remains for her, that ‡ Ino will soon suffer the same fate3 Athamas

will pursue her, and she will be thrown down, with her child in her arms,

into the sea, from mount Cithaeron.

AMPHITRITE.
She should be saved, for Bacchus' sake, whom she nursed and educated.

N E P T U N E.
Not when she is so wicked, Amphitrite; though Bacchus should certainly

beobliged.
AMPHITRITE.

But how happened it that {he fell off the ram, whilst herbrother, Phryxus,

was carried safely by him?

'¹‘ Nereids,] Sea-nymph5‚ daughters of Nereus and Doris. According to Hefiod, there were
no less than threescore of them. Groves were dedicated, and temples ereeted to them in seve-
ral parts of Greece, near the sea-shore. Amphitrite, one of the most famous amongst them,
is in this dialogue spokeswoman for the whole body.

{— Tl›‹·girl, &c ] Helle, daughter of Athamas king of Thebes, ancl Nephele3 she ran away
from her mother-in-law, as young ladies are very apt to do, and attempted to cross the sea on
a ram with a golden fleece, which her papa had given her, but was so frightened that ssie fell
into the sea and was drowned. The little arm of the place where the accident happened ever
after bore the name of the Hellespont.

ᾖ( Ino, Εὕα] The second wife of Athamas, who, in return for her cruelty to Phryxus and
Helle, his children by Nephele, ssew his son Lem-chus, and would have murthered her; to
avoid his rage, stre took her other boy, Melintus, in her arms, and threw herself into the sea,
where Ovid has turned her into a goddess. See Metam. b. iv.
