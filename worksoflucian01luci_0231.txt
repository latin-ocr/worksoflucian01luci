ORACLE 01= ‘ruz DEAD. ¹95

the same man, it often happens, who but a little before has majestically re—
presented Cecrops, or Erectheus, shall come forth as a poor ssave, it· the
poet so commands him. The play at length finished, every one of them
puts off his gilded robes, lays afide his niassz, and descending from his
busszins, walks about, like a poor and low fellow as he is, no longer called
Creon the son of Menaeceus, or Agamemnon the son of Atreus, but mere
Polus the Servian, son of Charicles, or Satyrus of Marathon, the son of
Theogiton. In such a light, after these spectacle, appeared to nie the

a&ions of mankind.

But, pray tell me, Menippus, those who, here upon earth, have such
splendid and magnificent sepulchres eredietl for them, who have their monu-
ments, statues, and inscriptions, do they meet with more honours and res-

pe& amongst the dead than the vulgar?

Not they, indeed. Iam sure you would never have done laughing, had
you seen Mausolus himself, the Cat-ian, so famous for his romb, contemptu.
oussy thrown into a little dark hole, amongst the common rabble: all that
he seems to enjoy of the monument is, that he appears miserably oppressed
by the weight of it3 for when AEacus, you must know, my friend, has al-
lotted to every one his proper place (and he never gives them more than a
foot a·piece)‚ there they must lie content, and contra& themselves according
to their stinted measure. You would have smiled to see some of our kings
and satraps turned beggars there, or selling salt fissi for their bread‚ or teach-
ing school, scoffed at, and buffeted like the meanest ssaves. Icould scarce
contain myself‚ when I saw Philip of Macedon there, as they pointed him
out to me, in a corner, ³* healing the wounds of old shoes: many others,

likewise, did I see begging in the highway; your Xerxes’s, Polycrates's,

andsoforth.

What you have told me, about our princes and great men, is truIy ridi-
culouS, and almost incredible: but how was Socrates employed, and Dio-

genes, and the rest of our philosophers ?

‚ ’ἦ Healing the wanda] Ακεμενοςτασαθςα, says Lucian: the expreffion is most happily ludi-
trous. My author has given us here a better Pagan hell than any of the ancient poem, and

dealt forth his rewards and punissiments with more equity, as well as with much more wit and

humour.
