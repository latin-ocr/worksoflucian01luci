it stiall be on him alone who knows every thing that is said about it by every

would not give him credit, unless ·l was satisfied· that he had himself seen :ill

So, indeed, it should seem, if it did not contradi& what you just now
mentioned, namely, that when we have spread our sails, and ventured on
the ocean, it is not always so easy to get back again: and how could a
man try every path, if, as you say, he may be detained and kept back in

theveryfirst?
