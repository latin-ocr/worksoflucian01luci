inconvenienee3 you want it n0t3 you are not cold, neither do you cook your
ambrofia, or stand in need of artificial light. XVhereas, to men, fite is ab·
solutely neceffary, as well for many other things, as particularly for sacri-
ficeS, to burn their incense, and roast their offeringsz the smoke, I know,
of them you are highly delighted with, and think that the noblest feast,
where the odourrises up to heaven, and columns of smoke are wafted to the
skies. This accusation, therefore, is absurd, and contrary to your own
mighty 'will and pleasure. Iwonder, for my part, you permit the sun to
ss1ine, whose flames are so much fiercer than mine, and that you do not ac-

cuse him also for diffipating your treasure.
. And now, Mercury and Vulcan‚ you have heard my defence; if you

think Ι have advanced any thing wrong or improper, corre& and disprove it3

I am ready to reply.

Prometheus, it is no easy matter to contend with so subtle a disputant as

you are; you may be happy, however, that Jupiter did not hear your
speech3 for, depend on it, if he had, he would have senta hundred

vulturs to prey upon your liver, instead of one: so severe have you been

upon him. But whatI most wonder at is, that you, who are so great
a prophet, should not have foreseen that this punishment must fall upon

you· PROMETHEUS.

Mercury, I knew it well; and 1 know also, that I {han hereafter be de-
livered from it; a friend of your's {hall soon come from 4 Thebes, and with

his arrows pierce the eagle that is now flying down upon me.
M E R C U R Y.

Ι heartily wish it may be so: that 1 may once see you free and caroufing
with us, on condition, though, that you are not the carver.

PROMETHEUS.

O, never fear: Jupiter will loose me soon, and for a very good rea-

son.
MERCURY.

XVhat is that pray? Do not conceal it from us, Ι intreat you,

ἥ Theben] Hercules.
