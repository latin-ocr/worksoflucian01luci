HERMOTIMUS. < 36⁷

the truth of all this? it is agreeable to what was first granted, though it
should certainly have been considered before, ‘r whether it ought to have
been granted, or not: if you give up that, the rest follows of course, and
you cannot refuse your assent, when it corresponds so well with the promises
admitted. And thus it is with y0u; from strong prepofl'effion, when you
have got into the path, without confidering whether it be the right one, you
are drawn into the consequence, true or false. If any body tells you that
twice five make seven, and you believe it without counting‚ he will soon
persuade you that four times five isvsourteen, or any thing else, just as it is
in the wonderful science of geometry, where they lay down certain absurd
postulata, which must be granted, such as individual points and lines with-
outlatitude, pretending, on such rotten foundations‚ to build demonstra-
tion, and to deduce true conclusions fron] false principles: in like manner
you also, taking for granted the principles of some particular sect, believe
every thing that follows from them, and embrace falsehood instead of
truth. Some of you die in the midst of their hopes, and before they have
found out that they were imposed 0n; others discover the deceit in their old
age, but are afhamed to acknowlege it, or to confess that, at their time of
life, they have been employed in such childish trifles ε they continue, there-
fore, in the same error, cry up what is before them, and exhort others to
embrace it, that they may not be the only dupes, but comfort themselves
with the thought, that thousands are in the same condition3 if they confess
the truth, they plainly perceive that they will not appear to be such grave
and respectable charaeters, exalted above the vulgar, or meet with such de-
ference and esteem as they used to do: they will never, willingly‚ acknow-
lege their ignorance, or that they are like the multitude. You will find very
few, indeed, that have courage enough to own that they have been deceived,
ὀι· who will diffuade others from treading in the same path ε if you light on
such a man, call him, as heis, the friend of truth, sober, just, or, if you
please‚ a philosopher, for he alone deserves that name; all beside, either
know nothing of the truth, though they pretend to it, or conceal their ig·

ἱ· thether it mugla] This puts us in mind of the question proposed by Chai-les the Second,
of facetious mernory, to the Royal Society ε lf a tub or veffel be filled quite, or brim full,
with water, and a large fifh be thrown into it—Qaere‚ why does not the water run oven—It is
somewhere‚ if 1 am not mistaken, related, that the Society puzzled themselves 3 long time
about the solution of this miraculous circumstance.-Never reflefting whether the fa& was true
