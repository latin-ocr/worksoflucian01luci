26 NIGRINUS.

fainted ; 1 endeavoured to speak, but could not3 my tongue faltered‚ my
voice was gone, and, at last, I burst into tearS. His discourse had not
ssightly affected me, or grazed the {kin alone, but left a deep and mortal
wound, and pierced, as it were, to my inmost soul. The mind, in my opi-
nion, of every well-disposed man, is like a soft mark, or butt3 many are
the archers in this life, with their quivers full of speeches of every kind;
but few amongst them aim aright: some stretch the cord too right, and
the arrow, sent forth with more force than is necessary, doth not stick in,
but paffing through, leaves the mind sore with its gaping wound3 whilst
others, from a looser bow, and want of strength to carry thern on, fall
short of the mark, and, with languid motion, drop down in the middle of
their course; or, if they reach the butt, tightly touch the surface of it,
and go no farther. But the ffiilftil marksman, like our philosopher, ex-
amines first the mark he is to ssioot at, with all poffible diligence and care,
to see whether it be soft or hard, for some are impenetrable 3 then dipping
his arrow, not in poison, like the Χ· Scythians, nor in opium, like the
Curetes, but in a kind of ssrarp, yet pleafing liquid, take a sure and cer-
tain aim : the † dart thrown out with that degree of force which is ne-
ceffary, and fixed in the center, diffuses its medicinal virtues over every
part of the soul. Hence it arises, that the hearer is ravished with the
sound; and, as he listens, diffolves in tears: as 1 myself experienced. I
could have said to him in the words os ss Homer,

Thus, always thus, thy early worth be try’d :

for, as not all who hear the Phrygiam pipe are seized with madness, but
only those whom S Rhea herself selet‘t53 so those alone are affected by

† ‘ske dart, &jc-J When Lucian lays hold of a favourite image, to illustrate his subject, he
is too apt, like ovid, to dwell too long upon it ; till his reader is tired with a constant repetition
of the same idea. This is the case with regard to the passage before us,
