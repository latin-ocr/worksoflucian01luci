fiissied person is once restored, he cannot be baniihed again. But I have done
with this point.

You will now consider who and what Ι am, the man who is to be thus
banished; I will not say that 1 was then ignorant and unskilful, but am now
a phyfician, nor was· my art then of any service to me: that l was then a
youth, and arn now of riper years, and would not rassily do an injury, fot
this also is of little consequence. At the time when he turned me out of his
house, though Ι did him no injury, yet had 1 done him no great service3 but
now, after Ι had so lately preserved, and merited every thing from him, after
this could any thing be rnore ungrateful, after such a danger got over by him,
ancl such a service performed by me, thus to reward me for it, to take no
notice ‘of his cure, but utterly to forget, and drive into solitude and obscuri-
ty, the man, who, instead of calling to mind the injuries received, not only
buried them in oblivion, but bestowed health. and happiness on his oppressor?

Nor was it a small or inconfiderable favour which 1 conferred on him, on
him who would thus repay me for it ;. but though he seems ignorant of it,
ye are not: ye well know what he did and what he suffered, in what a miser-
able condition he was, when 1 took him under my care, when all-the other
phyficians had· given him over, when his friends shunned, and were afraid
to corne near him 3· then did Ι restore him, then did I enable him to appear«
thus here against me, and dispute the power and sense of the legissatore. To
you rather, O father, let meshew this pi&ure; such you then were, as my
mother now is, and I restored you to your perse& mind. It is most unjust,
therefore, thus to reward me for it, to shew that perse& mind against me
alone, when even your accusation manifests how great a benefit 1 have be-
stowed on you: instead of this, haring me because Ι cannot cure her who ιε
incurable3 should you not rather, beyond measure, love and esteem him
who freed you from the like calamity‚ and fincerely thank me for it ? whilst
you, which is to the last degree ungrateful, are no sooner cured, than you
drag your preserver to the tribunal; cal-l back the remembrance of past of·
fences, and appeal to the same law. A noble acknowlegement indeed, to
the art that saved you, a fit reward for the remedy, thus to employ your
§enses against the phyfician who restored them !

Will ye then suffer him to persecute his benefactor, to banish his preserver,
to abhor the man who restored him, to depress the friend who raised. him ἓ
ye cannot do it, if ye have any regard to justice. Even if Ι had now been·
