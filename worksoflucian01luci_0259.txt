-ONSACRIFICES, 223

sacrificers ; they crown the animal with garlands, first taking care that it is
whole and perfect, that nothing impure and unworthy should be offered
up3 they lead it then to the altar, and, in sight of the god, murther it;
the creature making a melancholy noise, which they interpret as a lucky
omen, and accompany the dying sounds with the flute: who can suppose
but that the gods must be highly pieased with such a sight?

The edift sets forth, “ that none must dare to enter into the interior
part of the temple with impure hands ;’' but the high—priest, himself, stands
all over blood, like the ‘³⁶ Cyclops, pulling out the heart and the entrails,
ἦν sprinkling the blood upon the altars, and performing every thing that
is good and pious3 then, lighting the fire, he places on it the goat with his
skin, and the sheep with his wool on: then a holy fume, worthy of the
deity, ascends, and penetratts into, and diffuses itself by degrees‚ all over
heaven. The Scythian leaves all viffirns, which he thinks an ignoble sa·

crifice, and offers up men at the altar of Diana: and with this the goddess
is well pleased.

These customs, perhaps, are not worse than what we meet with amongst
the Phrygiam, Lydiam, and Affyrians. But if you go into Egypt you
will see many things truly worthy of heaven and the gods: Jupiter with
the face of a ram, the noble Mercury with that os a dog, Pan a goat

all over3 one in the ssiape of ssibis, another of a crocodile, another of
an ape.

there you will hear sophists, scribes, and prophets, with their heads
shaved, who will tell you, (crying out beforehand, drive away the pro-
phane from these doors), that the gods, afraid of the rebellion of their
enemies, the giantS, fied into AEgypt3 where, in hopes of being concealed,
