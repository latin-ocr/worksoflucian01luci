CHARoN}

LOOK ye, gentlemen, thus affairs stand: we have but a small boat, as
you see,* and that half rotten, and leaky in many places, if you lean it on
one fide or other, we overset, and go to the bott0m3 and yet so many of
you will press in, and every one carrying his baggage with him 3 if you do
not leave it behind, Iam afraid you will repent it, especially those who

cannot swim.
D E A D M E N.

What must we do to get safe over?

C H A R O N.
Ι will tell you; you must get in naked‚ and leave all your superfluities on

shore, and even then my boat will scarce be able to carry you : you, Mer-
cury, must take care, and let none come in, but those who are stark naked,
and have left all their rrumpery behind them3 stand at the head of the boat,
and make them strip before they come on board.

M E R C U R Y.
Righr, Charon, so Ι will: who is this first?
M E N I P P U S.

Menippus : Ι have thrown my pouch and my staff in before me, my coat
Ι did right to leave behind me.

M E R C U R Y.
My honest friend, Menippus, come in, take you the first seat at the helm,
near the pilot, and observe who comes : but who is this pretty fellow?
C H A R M O L E U S.
1 am the handsome Charmoleur„ of Megaram a kiss of me sold for two>

talents.
M E R C ,U R Y.

Please to part with your beauty, your ponderous head of hair, your sweet
kiffing lips, rosy cheeks‚ and fine sszin. It is well; you are fit to come in,
and may now enter: but here comes a fierce fellow, cloathed in purple,

- with a diadem on his head. who are you?
