like a hook, into the ocean, and raised up so many tempest33 the sea, as
if disturbed by his rhapsodies, rose in such a manner upon us, that, what
with storm and darkness, our veffel turned topsy-turvy. The poet grew}
fick, and vomited up aheap of verses on Scylla, Charybdis, and the Cy-

elops. MERCURY.

It was easy enough, indeed, for you to preserve a little, out of so plenti-

ful an evacuation.

But tell me now

’θ’ What chief is that, with giant strength endu’d,
Whose brawny shoulderS, and whose swelling chest,
And lofty stature, far exceed the rest ἓ

Μ Ε R C U R Y.
Milo, the Crotonian, a famous wrestler: the Grecians are applauding

him for carrying a bull over the course, a whole furlong.

C H A R O N.
How much better, Mercury, shall I deserve their applause, when Iput

this same Milo on board my little boat, as Ishall soon, when he comes
down to us, laid low by the great conqueror, Death, and wondering who it
was that tripped up his heels. Then will the memory of these crowns and

acclamations make him weep and lament: though now he plumes himself
thUS, because he is held in admiration for carrying a bull. What think you ?
Does he‘ ever expe& that he is to die?

M E R C U R Y.

CHARON.

well, let him alone, he will make us a good laugh when he comes down
amongst υς, and, instead ofa bull, will not be able to carry so much as a

gnat. But tell me who is that other venerable figure? No Grecian, 1 see,
by his dress.

⁸ What chief, Εὕα] These are the words of Priam to Helen, when he enquires of her con·
cerr-‚ing the Grecian heroes, in the third book of the lliad, and are there applied to Ajax. See
Pope’s transsation, book iii. l. ²90· As soon as Charon has informed Mercury how he came by

so much learning, he begins to shew it in his quotations. The lines suit one hero as well as
they did the other.
