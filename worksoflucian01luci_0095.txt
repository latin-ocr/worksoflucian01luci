CAUCASUS. 59

What you have been guilty of, Prometheus, calls, doubtless, for a long

and well studied speech3 but, for the present, it may suffice, briefiy to re-
capitulate the heads of our accusation against you. And, first, you stand in·
dieted for defrauding jupiter, and so dividing the ssesh as to keep the best
parts for yourself: secondly, for making men3 a thing which you ssmufd
by no means have attempted : and thirdly, for stealing fire, and carrying it
to them ε and, after committing all these crimes, you seem not to know, or

little cause he had to be angry, nor how childish it was in him to be in such

anger behind : to bear so long in his mind, and resent an affront of this na-

ture, was neither kingly‚ nor god-like. lf you take away these jefls and
sports from a feast, you will have nothing but drunkennesS, filence, and

satiety, things mighty unpleasant, and little suited to a merry-rnaking. N ever

panion with a good memory. Our countryman‚ Ben Jonson, therefore, amongst his club-
mles, now to be seen at the Devil Tavern, Temple-Bar, did not forget the caution of
Dicta qui foris eliminat eliminator.
Which may be transsated, if any one tells tales without doors, out with him.
