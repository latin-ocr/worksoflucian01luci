P L U T U S.
Because he has used me very ill, cast me away from him, and split me

into a thousand pieces ; nay, though Ι was like a father to him, beat me,
as 1 may say, out of doors; threw me out of his hand, as a man would

away upon whores and parafites? No: send me to those who wish for,
who will embrace me, and know my value3 not such stupid animals as

these, who make a league with Poverty, whom they prefer to me3 get a
garment of skins and a spade from her, and are glad to earn four farthings
by digging, though once they could give away ten talents without re-

ludlance.

Timon will never serve you so again ; his spade has taught him, by this
time (unless his belly is famine-proof), that you are much more defirable
than Poverty. But the truth is, you are a querulous malecontent, finding
fault with Timon for opening his doorS, and letting you go where you
will, instead of being jealous of, and {hutting you up at home3 and yet,
sometimes, you used to be angry with the rich, for confining you with
bars, bolts, and seals, in such a manner that you could never see the light.
This you lamented to me, and complained that you were buried in utter
darkness. Ihave met you pale and full of care, with your fingers con-

Such a horrible thing did you count it to be locked up, like Danae, in a
brazen or iron chest, or let out by a set of wretches on vile usury. They
aeted absurdIy, you said, in loving you beyond measure; and though they
poffeffed, not enjoying the object of their affeetion, but always watching
and fixing their eyes on the locks and the bolts that contained it, think-
ing it happiness sufficient to gaze upon it; not because they made use of

ἃ Not when I command you, δικ] Shakspeare‚ in his Timon, says,

 

Plutus, the god of riches,
was but his steward.

1 would advise my learned readers to turn to the Plutus of Aristophanes, and compare it with

Lucian's Timon. ·
