to the south of us; therefore, look you, my mend, we must remove Oeta,
and put Parnassus on top of all.
C H A R O N.
With all my heart3 but let us take care how we weaken the building‚ by

raifing it too high, lest, if we chance to fall with it, and break our headS,
we should prove Homer a bitter bad architeffi'c.

M E R C U R Y.
Courage, good Charon, and every thing will go well. Do you move
Oeta, and roll Parnaflus upon it : nowl will get up again: all is 'right3 Ι
can see every thing: come, mount yourself.

C H A R Ο N.
Mercury, lend me a hand, for this is no little hill that I arn to climb up,

laffureyou.
M E R C U R Y.

If you have a mind to see any thing, get up3 to be a lover of fights and
run no hazard is incompatible: but come, lay hold of my hand, and take
care you do not ssip3 very well: you are up3 and now, as Parnassus has
two tops, do you fit down upon one, and 1 the other, and we may look

about us: cast your eyes down upon the world below, and you will see

every thing. C H A R N

1 see a great deal of land, and a kind of large lake round it, with moun·

tains, and rivers, wider than Phlegethon or Cocytus; men too, that appear
very small, and some of their little hiding places.

M E R C U R Y.
Those little hiding places, as you call thern, are their cities.

C H A R O N.
Do you know, Mercury, we have been doing nothing all this while?

heaping Parnaffus, Oeta, Castalia, and all your mountains one upon an-
other to no purpose?

How so ?

MERCURY.

C H A R O N.
Because from this eminence Ι can see nothing distinffly. Befides, 1 wanted

to take a view, not of cities and mountains only, as we may in a map, but
of mankind3 to know what they do, and what they say: somethinglike
what happened to me when 1 met you first, and-you asked me why Ilaughed

so: for I had heard a thing that had delighted me prodigioussy.
