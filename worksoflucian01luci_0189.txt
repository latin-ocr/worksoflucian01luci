it is ἦ* Hellebore; for, contrary to those who are bit by dogs, you have the
dread, not of water, but of thirst.

T A N T A L U S.
I would drink hellebore itself, if Ι could get it.

M E N Ι P .
Be satisfied‚ Tantalus: for neither you Ιῑιοξειηξι of the dead must drink ς

it is inipoffible: they are not all of them, indeed, condemned to thirst‚
nor does the water expect thern, as it does you.

MINOS.

[ΕΤ this ruffian, Sostratus, be cast into Phlegethon: and that sacrile-
gious fellow torn in pieces by the Chimaera; and, do you hear, Mercury,
chain down the tyrant along with Tityus, and let the vulturs gnaw his livet:
but go γε good and virtuous into the Elyfian Fields, inhabit the issands of

the bleffed, as a reward for your piety and virtue whilst upon earth.

S 0 S T R A T U S.
Do but hear me first, Minos, whether I am right or not.

M I N Ο S.

villain, and killing so many people ?
S Ο S T R A T U S.
Granted z but confider whethermy punishment is just, or not.

M 1 N Ο 8.
Most certainly3 if every one should have the reward which they deserve.

S O S T R A T U S.

⁸ Hellebore.] A medicinal plant, constantly alluded to in the writings of antiquity, as a grand
specific against melancholy‚ folly, madness‚ and all the disorders of the mind. There are two
forts, the black, which we call the Christmas-rose, and the white, called neese-wort. The
issand of Anticyra, fituate against mount Oeta, was famous for the growth of this plant, whence
sprung the proverbial saying, of naviget Anticyram, send him a voyage to Anticyra. Amongst

the moderas, it has, some how or other, lost all its wonderful efficacy, and is very seldom used
amongst us.
