By Mercury‚ your prooemium is excellent, and according to the rules of
rhetoric3 but you should have added, that ³⁶ you conversed but a very little
time with him, that you came unprepared to speak, that it would have been
much more agreeable to have heard it from his own mouth, but that you
had brought away as much as you could commit to memory: would not
something of this kind have been of service to you ? but, with me, there is
no occasion for it ; ,for I am ready to clap and halloo for you 3 though if you
grow tedious Ι shall certainly be angry with, and hiss you dreadfully.

It is what Ι should expe& ; but remember, I shall not give it you in the

same order, nor in the same words, which he made use of3 for this 1 cannot
poffibly do, lest I should resemble those adron, who often put on the mask of
Creon, Agamemnon, or perhaps Hercules himself, and then strut about
in their golden vests, and from their fierce visages, and wide-gaping mouths,
send forth a weak womanish found, as feeble as a Hecuba, or Polyxena.
To avoid purting on a † mask, therefore, too big for my head, and dis-
gracing my part, Ι shall speak to you in my own proper person, that my
hero and 1 may not fink together.

⁴* That you conveaestd, ἕξω] Lucian is laughing at the formal and stated rules laid down, we
may suppose, by the teachers of rhetoric in those days, and which, like all other rules, never
made an orator. We meet with many, notwithstanding, fimilar to these, in Tully, and several
other writers on this subject. No less a man, however, than lord Chesterfield maintains the
possibility of making an orator by mere dint of art and industry invita Minerva: he tried
the nostrum on his son, but it did not succeed. See Lord Chesterfield’s Letters to his Son.

ἦ· A mqsk‚] The mask, used in the Greek theatre, was a kind of casque, or helmet, which
covered the whole head, representing not only the face, but the beard, hair, ears, and even, in
the women’s masks, all the ornaments of the coif, oi· cap; the most perse& and durable were of
wood‚ which were generally copied by the most eminent artists‚ from the busts or statues of the
principal persons represented, and consequently conveyed the most exa& resemblance of them.
This gave the actor an opportunity ofplaying several different parts in the same piece, without
being discovered; in so extensive an area as the Greek theatre, it might be necessary, by these
large and frightful marks, to exaggerate the features; but at the same time we must remem-
ber, that by all these exaggerations the natural expreffion of the eyes and countenance must be
entirely lost. After all, indeed, that can be said in favour of the ancient marks, it is scarce de-
fensible. The face is certainly the best index of the mind, and the paffions as forcibly expressed
by the features as by the words and gesture of the performer3 for my own part, Ι prefer the
English to the Athenian stage, in this as well as in many other particulars; though I will pro-
mise to join the προσωποφιλοι, and vote for the restoration of the ancient mask, whenever they
can shew me one that can represent the happy features of Qin‚ in Falstaff; or give us an idea
of a frantie Lear, like the look and face of the inimitable Garrick. See the Diss'ertation on
Tragedy‚ prefixed to my transsation of Sophocles.
