do it now. I know of no law which sayS, that when you have once cured any
man, you shall be obliged to cure all those whom 116 shall recommend to
γους that would be to make our patients masters over us, which surely were
of all things the most unjust: because I raised you from a most dang'erous ,
and dreadful malady, do you therefore think you have a right to 311 the be· ⁷
nefits and good effeets of my art? This 1 might have alleged in my own de-
fence‚ even if he had commanded me to do what it was in my power to per-
form 3 even then I should have been under no neceffity of obeying him in
every thing. But let us now proceed to consider what his commands were:
‘⁶ You c'ured me, says he, when I was mad3 my wife is now mad also, she
labours under the same disease, (for so he thinks it,) and in the same man-
1111 is given over by other phyficians 3 you can do every thing as you have
plainly shewn, cure her, therefore, and free her from her disorder.'’ All
this may seem very rational to the unlearned, and such as know nothing of
phyfic3 but, if you will permit me to plead for the art, I will convince you,
that every thing is not in our power3 that the. natures of the disorders are dif-
ferent, and the cure also, nor will the same medicines be successful in every
case: it will then appear, that -not to be willing, and not to be able, are
things very distant from each other. Permit me to philosophize a little on
this head, and do not condemn what I have to say upon it as ridiculous‚ un-
seasonable, and not belonging to the matter in hand.

In the first place, then, the natures and temperaments of all bodies are
not the same, though consisting of similar principles, of which some have
more and some less. Ι speak at present only of the bodies of men, which all
differ in their texture and disposition, and consequently the distempers which “
they are liable to must also differ. With regard to the nature and virulen·
cy of them, some are easily cured or removed, whilst others are quickly
caught, but desperate and incurable: to imagine, therefore, that all severs,
consumptions, inflammations of the lungs, or madneffes, are alike and of
the same kind in every body, is not to judge like rational men, who have
searched into the causes, and explored the nature of these things; for the
same disordcr is osten easily cured in one and not in another. In like man-
ner, as corn sown in disserent fields will appear different, what comes up in
a deep, well-watcred, and sunny soil, which is well tilled, and open to the
wind, will be full, fine, and yield many-sold ; whilst that which is scattered
in the mountainous, stoney earth, at the foot of hills, shall be just the con-

trary.
