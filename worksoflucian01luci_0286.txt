Aristotle, make more haste ε that is right: the wild beast is taken : we have got
you, rasca1‚ and will teach you soon who it is you have calumniated. &Vhat
shall we do with him? Let each of us find out a different way of killing
him, so we shall all be revenged: he ought to suffer θ’ seven deaths from

every one of us.

But first, by Jupiter, I will have him whipped.

Dig out his eyes.

Better pluck his tongue out.

What say you, Empedocles ?

E M P E D O C L E S.
Throw him into the furnace of mount AEtna, that he may take heed for

the future how he abuses his betters.

P L A T Ο.
Ο, best of all! like Orpheus, or Pentheus, let him be torn to pieces

amongst the rocks, that every one of us may take a bit of him before we go·

It is decreed, and nothing can save thee. Hear what ἶ Homer says—-
and expe& nothing but

ἥ Seven deaths.] That is, seven deaths from each of the seven philosopher-⁵ whom he had
abused: thus each man was to revenge, not only his own cause, but that of every one of hia
brerhren, who had suffered the sameindignity: this, no doubt, was the summum jus, which is
so often and so truly called summa injuria.

† Lct bz'm, iffa] The transcribers of Lucian have here, in my opinion, much injured the
original, by putting all the punistrments into the mouth of Plato, as the satire is certainly more
pointed by dividing them, as Ι have done in the transsation ι Plato is for hanging, Socrates for
whipping, Chrysippus for digging out his eyes, and Pythagoras (who the reader will remember
enjoined silence to his followers), is for cutting out his tongue t whereas, by making Plato
speak the whole, an the humour and propriety is lost.
