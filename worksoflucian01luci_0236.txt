now, 1 should not be at a loss ; from our spying·place there, we might have
overlooked the whole world: but, as it is not lawful for you, who are 21-
ways in the ssiades, to visit the regions above, we must search for some

high mountain.

You know, Mercury, what Iused to tell you when we were on board
of ship: if the wind blew hard, and the waves rose high upon υς, some of

you, who knew nothing of the matter, would be for furling the sails, let-
ting the sheet loose, or running with the wind, whilst I, who was a better
judge, told you to be quiet. Now here, my friend, Mercury, you are the
pilot,stheref0re, do what you like: I shall fit still, as paffengers ought, and

obey you in every thing.

You are right3 Ibelieve I know best in this case, and shall look out,

therefore, sor a proper observatory. Let me see; Caucasus, or Parnaffus‚
which is higher‚ or Olympus, which is higher than either of them: and,
now we talk of Olympus, something comes into my head that may be of
service to us·‚ butiri thisI shall want both your assistance, and implicit

obedience also.

Command, and to the best of my power Ι will obey you,

The poet Homer tells uS, that ³* the two sons os Alous, when they were

{ittle boys, tore up Offa by the roots, and wanted to put it upon Olympus,

ἓ Twofhns, &c.] Otus and Ephialtes. Homer tells us they were nine ells, that is eleven

yards and a quarter in height, when they were only nine years of age.

The wond'rous youths had scarce nine winters told,

When high in air, tremendous to behold,

Nine ells aloft they rear’d their tow'ring head,

And full nine cubits broad their shoulders spread,

Such were the youths ; had they to manhood grown,

Almighty Jove had trembled on his throne.

Pope’s Homer’s Odysi‘ey, book xi. 1. 31 ι.

And well, indeed, he might, ifthey could move Pelion and Offa, those immense mountain-5,
withso much facility. Longinus calls this strange fable, an instance of the true sublime in his
favourite poet. Lucian, with much more reason, treats it as absurd and ridieulous. ‘'‘hough
Homer is by no means answerable for the improbability of the story, which he only gives as he
found it. lt was undoubtedly one of those fiffions which the Grecians invented, to represent
the building of the tower of Babel, as it is at large explained and illustrared by the ingenious
and learned Bryant. See the beginning ofthe third volume ofhis Mythology.
