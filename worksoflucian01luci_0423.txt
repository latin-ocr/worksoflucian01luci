much variety, and all the riches of his art, in the management of one subje&,
representing a man so fierce and terrible, the hair so n‘obly dishevelled, rough
and flowing over the shoulders where itjoins the horse, and the countenance,
though smiling‚ amazingly wild and savage: the female Centauris a most
beautiful mare, of Thessaliam breed, such as had been never ridden, or
tamed: all the upper part resembling a very handsome woman, except the
ears, which are like a satyr's : that part of the figure, where the body of the
woman joins to that of the horse, incorporating, as it were, insenfibly, and
by ssow degreeS, so that you can scarce mark the transition, deceiving the
sight most agreeably: the ferocity that appears in the young ones, is, more·
over, admirably expreffed3 as well as the childilh innocence in their coun-
tenances when they look towards the young lyon, clinging at the same time
to the breast, and getting as close as poffible to their mother.

'When Zeuxis produced this work, he expected, no doubt, to meet with
universal approbation from the spectator53 every body, indeed, praised and
admired it·‚ and how could they do otherwise? above all they commended, as
my friends did with regard to me, the novelty of the invention3 said it was
a most uncommon subject, and unattempted by any of his predecefl'ors.
But, when Zeuxis understood that their admiration was confined entirely to

alone,runs away with all the praise and admiration.’'

Thus did Zeuxis ast, perhaps with too much resentment. There is some·-
thin'g simila-r to it in what happened to Antiochus», firnamed Socer, in his
war with the Gallo-GrecianS. I will tell you, if you please, that story als0.
This prince, knowing that his enemies were strong and numerous, that they
had a powerful phalanx in the van, armed with breast·plates of brass, and
twenty thousand horse to support them; besides, eighty chariots with scythes,
and as many without : against all these he had little hopes of success, his own
army being but just raised, and consisting of very few troops, most of them
light-armed soldiers, both horse and foot; he thought it therefore most pru—
dent to put an end to the war if postible, and conclude a peace with them;
but Theodotus, the Rhodian, a brave and ffiilful general, coming up, exhort-
