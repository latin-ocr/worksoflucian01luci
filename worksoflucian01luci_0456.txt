'of the stalks of asparagus. Near them, were placed the* Cynobalani, about
five thousand, who were sent by the inhabitants of Syrius; these were men
with dogs heads, and mounted upon winged acorns: some of their forces
did not arrive in time3 amongst whom, there were to have been some ssingers

from the Milky—way, together with the ἡκ Nephelocentauri: they indeed
came, when the first battle was over, and 1 ’,ἷζ wilh they had never come at

all: the flingers did not appear, which, they say, solenraged Phaeton, that
he set their city on fire.

Thus prepared, the enemy began the attack : the fignal being given, and'
the affes braying on each fide, for such are the trumpeters they make use of
on these occasions, the lest wing of the Heliots, unable to sustain the onset
of our Hippogypi, soon gave way, and we pursued thern with great ssaugh--
ter : their right wing, however, overcame our left. The Acroconopes falling
upon us with astonishing force, and advancing even to our infantry, by their*
affistance we recovered : and they now began to retreat„ when they found
the left wing had been beaten.. The defeat then becoming general, many of
them were taken prisoncrs, and many ssain ε the blood· flowed in such abun-
dance, that the clouds were tinged with it, and looked red, just as they ap-
pear to us at sun-set: from thence it distilled through upon the earth. Some
such thing, I suppose, happened formerly amongst the gods, which made*
Homer believe that ᾗ Jove rained blood at the death Of Sarpedon·-

When we returned from our pursuit of the enemy, we set up two trophiesgr
one, on account of the infantry engagement in the spider's web, and another
in the clouds, for our battle in the air. Thusprosperoussy every thing went
on, when our spies informed us, that the NephelocentaurS, who should have
been with Phaeton- before the battle, werejust arrived: they made, indeed,
as they approached towards us, a most formidable appearance, being half
xvinged horseS, and half men; the men from the waist upwards, about as·
big as the Rhodi-an Coloffus, and the horses- ofthe fize of a common ffiip of
burthen. I have not mentioned the number of them, which was really sov
great, that it would appear incredible: they were commanded by Η Sagittarius
