easy, and would prevent delay. We are told of a certain statuar-y, Phidias,
I believe it was, who, seeing the ³³⁶ toe-nail of a lion, could tell from that
of what fize the lion himself was to be made: and you yourself, if any one
stretched outa man's hand to you, and covered the body, could eafily, I
suppose, tell it was a man, though you did not see him3 and, in like man-
ner, it is easy, in a small part of a day, to get together the sum and sub-
stance of every thing that has been said on this matter, and all that nice en-
quiry, which takes up such a length of time, is unneceffary, with regard to
a judgment of what is best, as the whole may be known from that collection.

How weakly you argue, Hermotimus, to imagine that the whole can be

known from particular parts : Iliave always heard, on the other hand, that
he who knows the whole must know the parts als03 but he who is acquainted
with a part only, doth not, therefore, know the whole. But, pray, answet
me this question ; would Phidias, when he saw the toe-nail, have known it
to be a lion’s, if he had never seen a lion, or, when you saw the hand, could-
you tell it to be a man’s, if you had never seen a man ? Your Phidias, there·
fore, is not at all to the purpose, and [might well cry out, this is nothing to
Bacchus : how will you draw the parallel? Phidias and you might know the*
whole from the partS, because you were before acquainted with a rnan and a
lion3 but with regard to philosophers, Stoics‚ or any other, how from one
part could you know any thing of the rest, or how can you pronounce them
beautiful, when you are a stranger to the whole of which those parts confist?

As to what you say about the substance of philosophy being learned in a
day’s time, what the masters say about the first principles and ends of things,
their opinions of god and the soul, some calling every thing body, and others
holding that many things are incorporeal ; some placing the chief good in
pleasure‚ others in virtue3 all this, Igrant‚ may be learned without much
labour3 but to know which of these is in the right, will require, not a part
of one day, but a great many whole ones: have they written, think you, s0.
many hundred, so many thousand books, to prove the truth of what you
imagine to be so very clear, easy, and obvious to every capacity? Here, Ι arn
afraid, if you are impatient of delay‚ and will not examine every thing be-
* fore you make your choice, you must have a priest to decide it for you, The
most compendious way of avoiding delays and perplexity, in this case, is cer-
