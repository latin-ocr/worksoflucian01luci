333 HERMOTIMUs‚

H E R M Ο T 1 M U S.
I perceive, Lycinus, thatfyou laugh at me: but heaven approves my
choice3 nor do Ι repent of it; that is sufficient for me.

L Y C 1 N U S.
But not for me, my good friend3 surely you would> not leave me thus to

wallow in thesmire with the dregs and refuse of mankind.

H E R M O T 1 M U S.

Nothing that Ι say is agreeable to you.

L Y C Ι N U S.

Not so, my friend ; it is because you will say nothing that can be agreeable
to me: you are purposely close and reserved, and seem afraid that I should
become as good a philosopher as you are. I must, therefore, try myfelf to:
form ajudgment of my own, and* find out, if poffible, the true sect. Listerr
therefore to me a little, if you please.

HERMO-TIMUS.
‚With all my heart 3‘ you may advance something worth» knowin‘g.⁴

LYCINUS.

Attcnd then3 but do not laugh at me if 1 shew my want of skill, and (10β
it in an aukward manner3 as well 1 may, when even you, who know the:
thing so much better, are so obscure.

limagine virtue, then, as resembling a city (andss thus, perhaps, youi‘⁴
master would describe her), whose den-izens are all perfecitly happy, and per·-
fec'tly wisc, brave, just, temperate, and little less than gods: there you wilt
not see rnen, as amongst υς, guilty of theft‚ rapine, and injustiee3 proud„
arrogant, and oppreffive3 but all enjoying themselves in mutual peace and=
concord: nor is it to be wondered at, for all those things which in other
cities stir up strife and contention, and excite men to lay snares for and des-
troy each other, are banished from hence : they have no pleasure, glory, or
tiches to contend for, which are all driven from this place, as superfluous-

and unnecess'ary: here they live a peaceable and happy life, with good laws,

freedom, equality of condition, and every thing that is pleasant and de-

lireable.
HERMOTIMUS.

This, my friend, is a city which all would wish to inhabit: who would
*grudge their labour in the search of it, or think the way long that led «them
to such a place, if, after all, their names could be enrolled in it ?
