54 HALCYON.

how, Socrates, can we believe the tales you spoke of, that women can be
turned into birds, and birds into women? nothing seems to me more im·

probable. s o c R A T E S.

Short-fighted mortals, my dear Chaerephon, are but poor judges of what
may or may not be: we cannot go farther than human abilities will per-
mit us, and which are seldom able to see, know, or determine aright. The
easiest things appear difficult to us, and the plainest incomprehenfible;
partly from the want of knowlegc and experience, partly from the weak and
infantine state of our minds : all men in reality * are but children, be they
ever so far advanced in years; for brief as childhood, is, the utmost extent of
life: how then can those, who know not the power of gods and demons,
say what is possible οι· impoffible? You saw, my friend, how dreadful the
storm was but three days ago ; the thunder, lightning, and fury of the winds ;
we ssmdder even at the thoughts of it ; one would have imagined the whole
earth was torn to pieces, and finking into ruin ; and yet in a short time after
all was placid and serene, and has continued so to this moment. Was it
not, think you, as difficult to still the tage of that tempest, to change the
face of heaven, and adorn it with this tranquil beauty, as to transform a
»ᾗ woman into a bird ? Children, who know how to model in wax or earth,
will imitate various forms from the same materials; and shall not the diVine
power, so wonderful, and superior to our own, command and perform all
things with ease and pleasure? Canst thou tell how much greater the

heavens are than thyself?

What⁴ man, O Socrates, can conceive or declare it? It is infinitely more

than words can expresS.

How much do men, when compared one with another, differ in strength
and power! How much fr‘om themselves, at different periods of their lives ἔ
