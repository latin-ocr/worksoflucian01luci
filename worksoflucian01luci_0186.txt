DIALOGUE XV.

TERPSION Ant> PLUTO.

TERPSION.

PLUTO, is this fair and equitable, that Ι should die at thirty, and old
Thucritus, who is above ninety, be alive still?
P L U T O.

Most fit it is, Terpfion‚ that he should live, who never wished for the

death of any of his friends ; whilst you laid wait for his, in hopes of his

estate.
TERPSION.

Ought not the old, who can no longer enjoy life, to die, and make room

for the young?
P L U T O.

You would make a new law, Terpfion, that all those who can no longer
enjoy their riches with pleasure, should depart: but fate and nature have

otherwise determined.
T E R P S I O N.

It is adeterrnination which Ι cannot approve : the oldest, Ι think, ssiould
die first, and after him the nextin seniority, and so οὓς nor would Ι have
any old fellow absurdly continue to live, who has but three teeth left in his
head, and can scarce see out of his blear eyes ; who is forced to be support-
ed by his servant, a kind of animated sepulchre, without any taste for plea-
sure, and the mere laughing stock of youth ε whilst, at the same time, the
young, the beautiful, and the brave are snatched away: it is the running
back of streams to their fountain head ε at least one should know when old
fellows are to die, that one may not court thern for nothing3 but now, as
the saying is, we often ·:÷ put the cart before the horse.

P L U T 0.
These things, Terpfion‚ are much better ordered than you seem to think

'k Put the cart, &c.] The original proverb, as quoted by Lucian, is, literally transsated,
the cart ‹gften drags the ox, which approaches so nearly to our own familiar adage, that Ι have
ventured to adopt it, though it is seldom applied in this sense.
