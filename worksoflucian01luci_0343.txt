ONDEPENDANTS. 307

dom as the worst of calamities3 if by violence thou hadst been taken away
and carried into ssavery, thou wouldst have raved, complained‚ appealed to
the laws, and called heaven and earth to witness the indignity3 and yet with
all thy virtue and wisdom, even at an age when, if thou hadst been born a
ssave, it would have been time to 1001< forward towards liberty, thou couldst
sell thyself for a few pence3 'regardless of all that the noble Plato, Chry-
fippuS, and Aristotle had said in praise of liberty, and against shameful ser-
vitude: are not you ashamed to herd with parafites, and rascals; to be seen
amongst Romans, the only one, perhaps, in a foreign garb, talking bald
Latin, and frequenting noisy feasts, with crouds of men of bad characters?
At these entertainrnents you praise without judgrnent‚ drink more than you
can bear, and then, roused by the bell, before your sseep is half out, rise
up early, run about from place to plac'e, without wiping off the d‘nt of yes-
terday from your shoes. &Vas there no pulse, no wholesome herbs, no foun-
tains of living waters left, that you should be driven to this necessity? But
it is plain you do not chuse pulse and water3 dainties, sweet-meats, and
scented wines are more alluring : these must be paid for some way or other;
the collar, therefore, is put about your neck, and, like a monkey, you are
shewn for diverfion: and, in the mean time, you comfort yourself that you
can devour as many figs as you please3 whilst liberty, and her attendant vir-
tues, are buried in oblivion.

But the loss of your freedom is not the worst of this bufiness3 if that were
all it might be borne3 for the labour, you will say, is not the same as that
of common servants. And yet, let us examine whether your rask is not harder
than ‘'³'‘ Dromo's or Tibius’s ε that learning and knowlege, which, he says, in-
duced him to make choice of you, he has in fa& no notion of, nor does he
trouble himself about it. What, indeed, as the † proverb sayra, has the
ass to do with a lyre ? and yet how many there are who pretend to figh for v
the wisdom of Homer, the gravity of Demosthenes, the magnanimity of
Plato! though, setring afide their siches, there is nothing valuable about
them, as their minds are full of nothing but pride, ignorance, ill-nature,
and extravagance: he wants you nor, therefore, for your learning or know-
lege, but because you have got a long beard, and a venerable aspee't, and
wear a Grecian habit3 because you are known to be a grammarian, a phi-
