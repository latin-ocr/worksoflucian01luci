he need not divide it as our orators do, into three parts, but confine 'lt ιο
two, leaving out his address to the benevolence of his readers, and only s0-
liciting their attention and complacency ε their attention he may be affured
of, if he can convince thern that he is about to speak of things great, or ne·
ceffary, or interesting, or useful3 nor need he fear their want of complacen-
cy, if he clearly explains to them the causes of thingS, and gives them the
heads of what he intends to treat of.

Such are the exordiums which our best historians have made use of. He-
rodotus tells uS, “ he wrote his history, lest in process of time the memory
lhould be lost of those things which in themselves were great and wonderful,
which shewed forth the vietories of Greece, and the ssaughter of the barbar-
ians ;'’ and Thucydides sets out with saying, ‘⁶ he thought that war most
worthy to be recorded, as greater than any which had before happened3 and
that, moreover, some of the greatest misfortunes had accompanied it.” The
exordium, in short, may he lengthened or cont1·a<:‘ced according to the sub-
je& matter, and the transition from thence to the narration, easy and natural,
The body of the history is only a long narrative, aud as such it must go on
with a soft and even motion, alike in every part, so that nothing should stand
too forward, or retreat too far behind. Above all, the style should be clear
and perspicuous, which can only arise, as I before observed, from a harmony
in the composition : one thing perfed'oed, the next which succeeds should be'
coherent with it3 knit together, as it were, by one common chain, which
must never be broken: they must not be so many separate and distin& nar-
ratives, but each so closely united to what follows, as to appear one continu·

ed series.
Brevity is always necessary, especially when you have a great deal to say,

’ and this must be proportioned to the facts and circumstances which you have
to relate. In general, you must ssightly run through little things, and dwelI
longer on great ones, &Vhen yon treat your friends, you give them boars,
hares, and other dainties3 you would not offer them beans, * saperda, 01.-
any other common food.

When you describe mountains, rivers, and bulwarks, avoid all pomp and
ostentation, as if you meant to shew your own eloquence3 pass over these
things as ssightly as you can, and rather aim at being useful and intelligible.
