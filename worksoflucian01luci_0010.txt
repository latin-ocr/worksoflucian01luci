ii ΟΝ THE LIFE AND

myself so in whatI have said of you, I have given yon,
lthink, in my life-time, sufficient proof by my Dialogues
of the Decus: those who flatter a man may deceive, those
who court may betray3 but those who take pains to imi-

tate, have certainly the highest esteem for him. I endea-
voured to come as nearly to you as I could.

LUCIAN.

And were, upon the whole, tolerably successfu13 though,
50 say the truth (and truth you kuow is always spoken in
1 these regions), you are rather too grave to be quite Lu·-
esame, too polite to be merry, and too wise to be very en·-
tertaining. I speak with freedom on this head, and the
rather, because your DialogueS, however ingenious, are but
an inconfiderable part of that large property of literary
fame which you acquired, whereas they in reality make up
my whole estate3 you can bear therefore better than my-
self a little deductiozv from it.

LORD LYT‘TELTON.

In point of humour and irony, I must acknowlege‚ 1
'have followed yon,

Haud paffibus aequi-s.

There is a vei-n of ease and pleasantry in you-r works which 1
have always thought inimitable, nor do l know any author,
ancient or modern, that in this respec‘jt can enter into compe-
tition with you 3 and yet you are not half so much read, at
least amongst us, as many much inferior writersz the true
yalue and admiration of Lucian will, after all, Ι 3111 afraid,
in every age and nation, be confined to the judicious few,
who have a kind of claffic reverence for ancient story, and·
an enthufiastic love of the fabulous and poetical: to these*

his delicate satire and refined humour will always give in-
expreffible pleasure.
