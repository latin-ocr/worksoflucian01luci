sure and satisfaffion.
ln a little time after, my mother-in-law fell ill of a most dreadful and un·
accountable disorder, for such 1 observed it to be from the very beginning
of it; it was not a common temporary madness, but an old, inveterate and
fixed distemper os the mind, which broke out on a sudden: there were
many symptoms attending ir, which plainly shewed that it was incurable3
one thing, indeed, very remarkable in this woman's madness was, that,
whilst others were present, it was sometimes tolerably mild and calm, but if
χ at any time she saw a physician, or even heard the name of one, the disor-

profess.

not permitted fathers to banish or difi'nherit all their children, nor as often
as they please‚ nor for every cause3 but as= it hath >given parents leave to be
angry with their children, so hath it likewise provided that children shall.
