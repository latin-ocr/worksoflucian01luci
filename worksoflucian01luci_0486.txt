450 THE TYRANT-KILLER.

, adversary opposes me, not from his love of public justice, but because it

should seem, he is concerned for those who are ssain, and would revenge their
death on him who destroyed them.

Permit me, reverend judges, to lay before you what you have yourselves
experienced, the miseries of tyranny3 thus shall ye be> more senfible of the—r
benefits which I have procured sor you, and of the weight of those evils fromr
which you are delivered. We have not, like others, groaned beneath one
tyranny alone, nor borne the insolence of one master only, but felt the lash
of two cruel tyrantS. The old rnan was, indeed, much the more tolerable,
more easily appeased, more ssow to punishment, and with more prudence re-
strained those appetites and passions which his age did not permit him to in·
dulge tv he was not himself os so arbitrary a disposition, but from the first was
urged on by his son, ¹to adis ofcruelty and oppreffion : to him he yielded in
all things, being remarkable for his paternal affed‘don, as his death sufficient-
ly evinced. His son was every thing to him, and him he obeyed. What-
ever a& of injustice the son commanded, the father performed3 when the
son bade him, the father punished: the son, in short, tyrannized over the
father, and the father was no more than an officer under the son, to do his

will and minister to his defires. The young man, indeed, out of respeet to κ

his age, did hot take the title of king, though he was, in effe&, at the head
os every thing. He took care to preserve the power in his hands, at the
farne time he was the source of every injury. He iffued out orders to the
guards, he repaired the bulwarks, he terrified the conspirators, cut off the
oppressed and rebellious subje&s, deflowered virgins, and abused the mar-
riage-bed3 murthers, banishments‚ seizing of goods, tortures, injuries of
every kind were his constant practice. The old man connived at all he did,
and approved of it: it became at length too horrible to be suffered by us.
When the evil affeetions of men have the power os ernpire¹ to support them,
they know no bounds. xWhat most afflid‘ted us was, that we knew our
ssavcry must be of long duration, or rather without end3 and that we should
be delivered down from one wicked tyrant to another: others might comfort
themselves, and sav, This must end soon, he willdie, and we shall be free.
But we had no such hopes, for the successor was ready and prepared to take
the empire: yet none of all those, who thought as I did, would dare to

strike a stroke3 all hopes of liberty were lost, and that tyranny was thought
invincible‚ which had so many to support it.
