374 HARMONIDES.

ing composed the music: whartongue did not then resound with the praises
of Timotheus the Theban! and even to this day, wherever you appear, the
people ssock round you, as all the feathered tace do round the bird of
night. It was this that animated me to the study of the flute, and for which
alone Ι have taken so much pains3 nor would I with to excel in it, were Ι
to remain inglorious and unknown, even though 1 had the sszill of a ³* Mar-
syaS, or Olympus. † Hidden talents, as the proverb says, are of no value:
teach me, therefore, how I may distinguissi myself, and my art also, so
shall I be doubly obliged to you, both for my skill in mufiC, and the glory
which Ι shall acquire by it.

To this Timotheus thus replied. “ Your ambition, HarmonideS, is
noble3 to acquire honour and glory, and bc distinguished amongst men, is
no mean or inconfiderable reward ; this you are defirous to obtain, by ap-
pearing in public„ and displaying your abilities before the multitude: but
even by doing this you will not be universally known 3 for where will you
find a theatre to perform in, large enough to contain all Greece: the only
method by which you can ever gain the defired end is, in my opinion, this;
ssxew yourself sometimes on the public stage, but depend not on the multi-
‘tude ; there is a ⁴ssiorte1·‚ and an eafier way to glory3 chuse out the best and
noblest of the Grecians, the wife few, who are acknowleged judges, and on
whom you may rely, if they admire and praise you, you will soon be known
to all the world belides: for if those, whom all commend, commend you,
what occafion will you have for the approbation of the vulgar, who always
follow those that can decide better than themselves? The multitude is com-
posed of low and ignorant airtifioers, those whom the great praise, they will
praise also. In the public games, the spefi'tators, we know, clap and hiss,
but it is only four .o.r sive who judge and.determine.''

Such was the advice of Timotheus, but Harmonides lived not to profit
by it3 for the first time he contended ‚in public, exerti-ng himself too strenu-
oussy, from an ardent defire of succesS, he breathed his last, we are told,

upon the instrument, and, without gaining the crown of victory, died on
the spor.

ἃ Marsyas.] Plato tells us that we arc indebted to Marsyas and Olympus for wind-music.
To them is likewise attributed the invention of the Phrygian and Lydian measure. Marsyas is
also said, by some, to have been the inventor of the double flute, though others give it to his
father HyagiuS. For a farther account of these eminent musicians, see Burney's Dissertation-
