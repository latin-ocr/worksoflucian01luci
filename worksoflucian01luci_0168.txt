but as to those parafiteS‚ young Charinus, Damon, and the rest of them,

conduct them this way as soon as you please.

Not at all: it is but justice; for what has he done to them, that they

should wilh him to die ? unless it is merely because they have no right to
expe& it. But what shews their villainy most, is, that whilst they are thus
praying for his departure, yet, to all outward appearance, they seem to wor-
{bip him3 when he is fick, their consultations together plainly shew their
intentions, though, at the same time, they pretend they would sacrifice their
lives to recover him ε but the adulation of ξ’ *ese wretches puts on a thousand
different shapes. Let him, therefore, be immortal, and let them gape in
vain for his riches, and march off before him.

cajoles them pretty well himself, and feeds them up with false hopes ; looks
as if he was going to die, and, at the same time, is as well and hearty as
themselves: they, in the mean time, are dividing the spoil, and enjoying,
in imagination, the happiness of their future fortune.

Let him, therefore, shake offthe old man, and, like Iolaus, grow young
agaim and they, leaving their dreamed-of treasures‚ die miserable, like
wretches as they are, and make us a vifit here below.

M E R C U R Y.

Pluto, make yourself easy, I shall take care to conduCt them hither one

by one: there are, 1 think, seven of them.

P L U T O.
Bring them away3 and, as for him, let him send them before him, and

grow young as fast as he can.
