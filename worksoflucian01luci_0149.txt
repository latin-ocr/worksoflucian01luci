DIALOGUE'XXXVI.

NEPTUNE ΛΝΒ ALPHEUS.
N E P T U N E.

HOW happens it, Alpheus, that you alone, of all the rivers that run
into the sea, never mix with the salt water, as others do, nor cease flowing,
though your waters are so widely diffused, but still, as if bound in ice, keep
on your course, pure and unmixed, through the ocean ; sometimes, like the
gulls and herous, you dive into the deep, and rise up again.

A L P H E U S.
It is a 4 love affair, Neptune, and therefore you will pardon me, as you
are yourself no stranger to that paffion.

N E P T U N E.
Is it a woman, a Nymph, or a Nereid that you are in love with ?

A L P H E U S.
Neither, but afountain.
N E P T U N E.

And where fiows she ?
A L P H E U S.

In the issand of Sicily: her name is Arethusa.

N E P T U N Ε.
Ι know her, and she is not ugly 3 it is a pure limpid fountain‚ and, as it
glides over the pebbles, {hines like filver.

A L P H E U S.
1 see you know it well ε thither I am now going.

N E P T U N E.
Away then, and success attend you! but where could you see Arethusa,
you an Arcadian, and she in Sicily?

A L P H E U S.
You delay me, Neptune. with assring impertinent questions.
N E P T U N E.
I do so; therefore begone to your mistress, rise from the sea, mix with
your beloved fountain‚ and become one river.

ἥ A Iove affair‚] When the Greeks carne into Sicily, they met with a river of the farne name,
or pretty near it, as one which they had been well acquainted with in their own country3 with·
out enquiring into the cause of this, they carried the river all under the sea, and their poets
soon worked it up into a love story, which makes the subject of this dialogue.
