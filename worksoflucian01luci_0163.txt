⁶ A Latin poem, on this subject, which gained the first prize in the year ¹740 (or there-
abouts)‚ was written by the very ingenious and learned Dr. W. Markham, now Lord Archbiihop
of York, tinen student of Christ-Choreb College, Oxford3 which, for claffical purity, and ele-
gance of style, is, perhaps, superior to every thing of that kind. The author, as will appear
by the comparffon, was no stranger to this dialogue, which he has greatly improved upon.
