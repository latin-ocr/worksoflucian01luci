MARS ANDMERCU‘RY.

M A R S.
DID you hear, Mercury, how Jupiter threatened us ? Such boasting, and
so ridiculous too l ‘⁴ Ι will hang ᾖ a chain,’' says he, “ down from heaven,

and you shall all of you get at one end of it, and pull against me, to no pur-
pose, for you will never draw me down ς whereas, if Ι have a mind to lift it
up, I can not only draw you, but the earth, and sea, together with you, into
heaven.'’ Thus he went on with a good deal rnore stuff of the same kind.

Now, though Ι think him stronger than e'er a one of us3 yet, that he alone
is so powerful as to xveigh us all down, even if we took the earth and seas to

our affistance, is what Ι will never believe.

Μ Ε R C U R Y.
Softly, good Mars3 it is not safe to talk thus, lest we suffer for our prati'ng..

ἃ Ι will hang a chain, Εὕα] Alluding to that pdss'age in the eighth book of Homer’s Eiad,
where Jupiter threatens all the deities with the pains of Tartarus, if they affist either fide in the.-
2pproaching battle. It is thus transsated by Pope:

Let down our golden everlasting chain,
VVhose strong embrace holds heaven, and earth, and main ζ,
Strive allos mortal and immortal birth,
To drag by this the thund’rer down to earth z.
Ye ssrive in vain ! if 1 but stretch this hand,
1· heavejahe gods, the ocean, and the land ;
I fix the ehain to great Olympus height,
And the vast world hangs trembling in my fight.

There is something in the idea of this long chain, which, in spite of all that the critics have
urged in its defenoe, borders nearly on the ridiculous. It certainly struck Lucian in this light,

az he takes frequent opportunities of laughing at the absurdity of it. M A R S
