PROMETHEUS. 11

them as measuring the *⁴'r' leaps of fleaS, to ridicule their subtle reasonings
about things far above them; whilst Dialogue, on the other hand, employed
herself in grave disputations concerning the nature of thingS, and the virtues
of philosophy3 running, like the musician, through all the chords, from
the lowest to the highest note: these oppositeS, which will never blend or
afl'ociate together, have Ι rashly endeavoured to reconcile and unite, and
therefore, Ι sear, shall buttoo nearly resemble your Prometheus, who
blended male and † female, and, like him, shall be condemned for it3 or
rather, perhaps, for eovering the 1 bones with fat, and deceiving my rea-
ders, by mixing comic mirth with philosophica] gravity. As to theft‚ (for
there is a § god of theft, you know,)I am sure you will acquit me of it, for
whence ssrould Ι steal? unless there be one in the world, which I do

not believe, who makes as strange monsters as myself3 but what, after

all, must I do, but perfist in the way I began? it was u Epimetheus, and
not Prometheus, that was given to change.

’ἢ Lcaps ofsteas,] See the Clouds of Aristophanes, a& i. scene 2. where the great Socrates is
ridiculoussy represented as calculating how far a flea can go at a leap-

† Lucian tells us, in another place, that the principal crime attributed to Prometheus was
(an observation not very favourable to the fair sex) his making of women.

ἶ, cI'he bones withfat,] Prometheus, according to the fabulous history, once upon a time
played Jupiter a ssippery trick ; he killed two large oxen, in the skin of one of thern he inclosed
all the fat and flesh of them both, and in the other put nothing but the bones. Jupiter, who
was to have his choice, took the latter, and Prometheus, who was a wag, laughed at the iest;
which he afterwards paid dearly for, when the vultur gnawed his liver on mount Caucasus.

§ Godof thcfl,] Mercury.

ῃ Epimetheus,] Epimetheus, we are told, was the son ofJapetus and Clymene, and husband
to the famous Pandora3 he is likewise supposed to have been an excellent statuary, and changed
into an ape, probably because his figures approached nearly to real life. Lucian, who is now

and then fond ofa pun, seems only to have mentioned him here from a fimilarity of sound be-
tween the words Pro-metheus, and Epi-metheuS.
