As far as promises and profeffions g0‚ we have guides enough; hundreda
stand ready, and tell us they are inhabitants just come from thence: and as
to ways, there is not only one but many to it, and all different from each
other3 one leads to the east, another to the west, one goes north, another
south3 some carry us through flowery groves, meads, and pleasant ssiades,
without thorns or briars, whilst others are rough and stony, through per-
petual heat, thirst, and labour3 and yet all, they tell us, lead to one city,
though they every one bring us out through paths direCssy oppofite. Thus

there rneets you one, worthy no doubt of all your confidence‚ who stretches

thern. Itis this „variety of ways which distra&s and confounds us, where
each guide contends for, and praises his own, Icannot tell which to fol-

Because one, for instance, strikes into Plato's road, and with him, praises
that alone3 a second goes into that of Epicurus, a third to another master,

You have not, therefore, removed rny doubts, for still I am as ignorant
as before, and know not on which traveller Ι must rely ; for 1 perceive that

each of them, together with his gulde, has tried but one way, which he
