kind: They know from whom it eomes, distinguish every fiower, and ad-
mire, praise, and envy him, who gathered it: though, in truth, their
vpraises are due to you alone, and to that fertile meadow which produces

blend and unite them, that they may recommend and adorn each other.
And can he, who thus enjoys your bounty, speak ill of those to whom he is
so much obliged3 those, to whom alone heis indebted for his charathr,
and reputation? unless he were of the same disposition with 4 Thamyris,
or † Eurytus, of old, who pretended to vie with the very Muses, that in-

taught him the use of the quiver.

This is all rhetorical declamation, directly contrary to the truth‚ and only
makes your insolent behaviour more unpardonable3 to the injury, you have
done υς, it adds ingratitude also; for receiving, by your own confeffion,

who, growingjealous, took his eyes and lyre away from him.

ἦ· Eur-yrun] Eurytus was king of Oechalia, and famous for his skill in archery. He pm-
posed his daughter, Iole, in marriage, to any person that could conquer him at the exercise of
the bow. This, probably, gave rise to the story of his rivalling Apollo, and being ssain by
him. Homer calls him, vain Eurytus,
whose art became his crime,

Swept from the earth, he perish’d in his prime.
