about i'n the air, they get together over the coals, snuff up the scent of them,
and this serves them for vistuals. Their drink is air squeezed into a cup*

He who is quite bald, is esteemed a beauty amongst them, for they abo-v
minate long hair3 whereas, in the comets, it is looked upon as a perfeetion
at least; so we heard from some strangers who were speaking of them: they
have, notwithstanding, small beards a little above the knee‚· no nails to their
feet, and only one great toe. Every one has a large cabbage on his bum,
growing out like a tail, which is always green, and even if they fall upon ir,
never breaks. They have honey here, which is extremely lharp, and when
they exercise themselves, walh their bodies with milk ε this, mixed with a
little of their honey, makes excellent ‘⁵ cheese. Their oil is extraE‘oed from
onions, is very rich, and.sme11s like ointment. Their wines, which are in

which they can open and shut as they please‚ as a kind of bag, or pouch,

you, that they have eyesaewhich they take in and out whenever they please3
so that they can preserve them any where till occasion serves,.. and then make
use of them ε many who have lost their own,‚borrow from others 3 and there
are several rich men who keepa stock of eyes by thern. Their ears are made
of the leaves of plane-trees„ except of those who spring, as 1 observed to
you, from acorns: these alone have wooden ones. Isaw likewise another
very extraordinary thing in the king's palace,. which was, a looking-glass
that is placed in a well not very deep3. whoever goes down into the well,
hears every thing that'is said upon earth, and if he look-s into the glass‚ be-
