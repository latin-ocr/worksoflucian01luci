On adiligent enquiry‚ Sostratus, you will find out many things of this
kind not eafily to be accounted for3 and all you can gain by your disco-
veries will be, to the title of thief, to add that of sophist also: however,
let him go, Mercury, without any farther puniffiment; but take care you
do not teach other ghosts to ask the same questions.

DIALOGUEXVII.

DIOGENES ΛΝΒ POLLUX,

D I Ο G E N E S·
POLLUX, I charge you, when you return to the other world, for I think

you are to come to life again to-morrow‚ if you see Menippus the Cynic
(you will find him, probably, either in the Craneum at Corinth, or the Ly-
caeum, laughing at the philosophers quarrels with one another), speak thus to
him : Diogenes commands you, O Menippus, when you have laughed
your fill at things upon earth, that you would come down and laugh still
more at things below z there it may be a doubt whether you should laugh or

not, and it is a common saying amongst you, “ Who knows what is to come
hereafter ?” But here you will laugh for ever, as 1 do: especially when you
see the rich and great, kings and nobles, sunl< into such meanness and ob-
scurity‚ and only distinguished by superior misery. Tell him how poor and
contemptible they seem, in comparison to what they were above, when they
recolleCi: their former state: tell him, at the same time, to fill his bag with
lupineS, or, if he can piel< up ἥ Hecate’s supper in the highway‚ or an egg
left at a sacrifice, or any thing of that kind, to bring it with him.

Diogenes, I will tell him what you defire me; but how ssiall Ι know him?

What sort ofa face has he?
D 1 O G E N E S. .

He is an old fellow, with a bald pate, in a tattered garment, full of holcs,
and open to every wind, and patched up with rags of different colours : he is
always laughing‚ and remarkably severe upon the proud philosopher-5.
