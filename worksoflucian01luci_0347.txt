ONDEPENDANTS.— 311

rest: but even that relief is often denied you; for your disorder, they will
say, is only a pretence, and to avoid doing your duty3 with all this you
grow pale, and look like a man just at the point of death.

Such is your town life. When you gojournies into the country, which of-
ten happens, you will meet with more difficulties. Amongst others, if it rains
ever so hard, you must corne last (for that is your place), and walt for the
carriage, and, perhaps, if there is no room there, must be stuffed in with
the cook and your lady’s chambermaid in the litter, with hardly straw enough

to keep you warm.
ἦ And here 1 cannot help relating what Thesmopolis the Stoic philosopher

told me once happened to him, and, ridiculous as it is, rnay not improbably
happen to others also. He lived some time in the house of a very rich and
delicate lady ·‚ and one day, when they went abroad together, it fell out that
a certain minion, with a smooth·shaved chin, and all over perfnmes, who,
we may suppose, was in high favour with the lady, was ordered to take his
place next to our philosopher: his name I think he told me was Chelido-

chariot with you, and take care of her, for 1116 is ill andjust ready to pup, and
those aboniinable careless servants will give themselves no trouble even about
me, much less about her; during the whole journey, be affured, therefore, you
will confer no small obligation on me, by prescrving my sweet dog, which I
