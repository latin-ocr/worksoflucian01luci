DIALOGUESoF THEGODS. ¹25

P A R I S.
Iam not to be swayed by bribes‚ but (hall judge according to equity:
you may retire. Minerva, approach.
M 1 N E R v A.
Iam here: if Ι am judged the handsomest, Paris, you shall never be
overcome in battle, but always return a conqueror: 1 will make you a

warrior, and vistorious.
P A R Ι S.

Minerva, Idelight not in war : peace, as you see, reigns in Phrygia and
in Lydia, and my father's empire is free from every enemy ι but do not be
afraid that you should lose the prize, because Ι accept not of your offen
dress yourself, and put on your helmet, I have examined you sufficiently.

Now, let Venus appear.
V E N U S.

Behold me here: pass over nothing unobserved, but examine separately,
and dwell on every limb ancl feature. Mind, withal‚ what I say to you:
long fince have 1 admired you, as the handsomest youth in all Phrygia ; thy
beauty shall make thee happy: but I am angry with you for not leaving
these rude rocks, and coming into the city3 you ssiould not waste your beauty
thus in solitude. What can you enjoy in these mountains? or what is that
fine form to your herds and flocks: you should ere this have been married,
not to some rustic inhabitant of Ida, but to some fair Grecian, of Argos,
Sparta, or Corinth, such as Helen, the young and beautiful, not inferior
even to me in charms; and, what is better still, a votary of love3 were she
once to behold you, 1 know {he would leave all mankind to follow and live

with you. Have you never heard of her?

P A R Ι 8.
Never: but I should be glad to hear every thing you know concerning

her.
V E N U S.

She is the daughter of that beautiful Leda, whom Jupiter courted in the

ihape of a swan.
P A R I S.

What sort of a face has she?
V E N U S.

Fair as the swan from whom she sprang‚ sost as the egg she was nourished
in3 an obje& so universally defirable, that a war was kindled on her ac-

count, when she was yet a child, and Theseus ran away with her at ten
years
