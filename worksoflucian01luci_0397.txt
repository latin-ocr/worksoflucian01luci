HERMOTIMUS. 361

HERMOTIMUS.

And what is that?
L Y C Ι N U S.

Judgment, ingenuity, acuteness3 a sharp, penetrating, uncorrupted un-
derstanding, which is indispenfibly neceffary in forming a decisive opinion in
these things, and without which, all our labour will be vain and fruitless:
there must be withal, a great deal of time to consider of every thing3 nor
must we regard the age or charad’oer of the man, nor his reputed wisdom z
we must a& as the judges of the ΞΕ Areopagus do, try the cause by night and
in the dark, that we may attend, not to those who speak, but to that which
is spoken: then, when our choice is fixed and determined, we may be at li-
berty to philosophise.

HERMOTIMUS.

Yes; after death : for, according to you, no man’s life is long enough to
go through all, examine, choose, and after the choice is made, to enter on
philosophy3 and yet this, you say, is the only method.

L Y C I N U S.

Ι am sorry, Hermotimus, to add that even all this, may not be sufficient:
we may rassily conclude we have discovered something certain, and yet
have found nothing; like fishermen, who, feeling something heavy in their
nets‚ draw them up, itnagining that they have got a plentiful draughr,
when, behold, a stone appearS, or an earthen veffel full of sand : such, perhaps,

may be our fate.
HERMOTIMUS.

What you mean by your nets, I know not, but you have fairly caught

meinthem.
L Y C 1 N U S.

Get out then as fast as you can3 for you can swina, thank heaven, as well
as any body. For rnyself, with all l can do, 1 have not yet discovered, nor
perhaps ever shall, whether any of us have yet found out what we are in
*search of, or are all still ignorant of it.

HERMOTIMUS.
Has no body found out the truth rhen?

‘ The Areopagus.] The great cour‘t of judicature at Athens, where we are told they tried
causes by night, for a very ridiculous reason, which Lucian here alludes to. justice Fielding
(who has as much sagacity as any of the Greek judges had) does the-same. But this mode is
not from cimice, but neceffity ς and will probably soon be adopted in Guild Hau, or the King's

Bench. ⁷ ,
