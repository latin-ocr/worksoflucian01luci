in the right to throw himself into the deep ocean, or down from the steep
promontory, if by that means he could escape from the cruel hand of
penury.'’

Such are the apologies which might be made use of in this case, not one
of which, to say the truth, is very satisfactory3 make yourself easy, my
friend, notwithstanding, for 1 shall not rest my defence upon any of them.
Never ssiall Argos be so pinehed by famine, as to be obliged to endeavour
to·cultivate ‘r' Cyllarabis; nor I, it is to be hoped, ever stand‘ so much in
need of an apology, as to flee for ssielter to arguments so poor and con-
temptible. Consider the great difference there is between coming into a great
man’s family for hire, submitting to every kind of ssavery, and suffering all
the hardships mentioned in my book, and entering into a public employ-
ment, performing it to the best of your abilities, and receiving a reward
f20m the emperor for it! Reflest on the fituation of these two men3 they
are at least, as we say in mufic, † a double oetave distant from each other,
and no more alike than lead is to filver, brass to gold, the rose to the ane-
mone, ora man to a monkey. Both, indeed, are paid for what they do,
and both do it by command of their superiors; but still the thing itself is
very different with regard to each of them; for in the first, the ssavery is
manifest, they are no better than common servants; whereas those who are
in a public employment, who make themselves useful to whole cities and
kin'gdoms, surely it would be unjust to abuse, and put on a level with the
other, merely because they were rewarded for it; as, by this rule, such as
held the greatest offices, diree‘ted the state of nations‚ or had the care of
legions and whole armies entrusted to them, would be deemed dishonourable‚

because they also have a reward; all, therefore, are not equally to be con-
demned who are paid for their 'labours τ nor did I ever say they were equally

unhappy3 I only pitied those who served for hire, in the charadber of tutors
and instructors: but the employment which I am engaged in, my friend,

of Κωλη Αραὲ.η, cava Arabia, which was unintelligible. Thia Cyllarabis was a gymnasium, or
place set apart for public exerciseS, and sacred to the gods, consequently, not to be employed
for any prophane use3 even in times of famine, therefore, they were not to sow or plant init.
The expreffion was, perhaps, proverbial, and means just the same as if we were to say, let us
want bread ever so much, we must not turn St. Paul's into a plough field.
