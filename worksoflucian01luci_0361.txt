HERMoTIMUS‚

ADIALOGUE.

Lucum, in the Charac‘i‘er of Lchth, which he affantes in this Dialogue‚
laughs at the various Sefis of Philofiiphers, rallz'es their Absurdities‚ condemns their
partial Attachments to their own Tenets, and exposes their Pride and Ser-sufficiency,
His Irorgyt is delicate, his Allufions ingenious, and most of his Arguments, in fct-
vour of that Scepticistn which he suppares, unanswerable. A Vein of good Sensi?
and clqse Reasoning runs through the whole. The Style is clear, flowing, and

perspicuous.

This is said of physic, a thing much eafier learned than philosophy, which
cannot be attained even by length of time, unless we keep our eyes perpetual-
ly fixed upon it, and of no little moment is that trial, which is to determine
whether we are to be miserable, amidst the filth and pollution of the vul·

gar, or lead a life of philosophie happiness.
