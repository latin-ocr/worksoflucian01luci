haps, being denied admittance, and thrust out by his servants, whilst he,
scarce observing them, dreffed in purple, or gold, or some robe of various
colours, at last, would condescend to make them happy, by stretching forth
his hand or breast for them to kiss.'’ This discourse of mine galled them

most severel .
Whilst Ι ἕως there, one remarkable cause was determined by Minos, on

the favourable fide. Dionysius, of Sicily, who had been accused by Dion
of many heinous crimes, and condemned by the Stoic porch, was just on
the point of being chained to the Chimaera3 when Aristippus, the·
Cyrenian, who is highly revered, and has the most powerful iufluence
in the infernal regions, procured 3 reverfion of the sentence, by alleging
that he had been liberal to learned men, whom he frequently relieved by his
bounty.

We now left the seat ofjudgment‚ and proceeded to the place of punish-
ment: where a thousand dreadsul objefts presented themselves to us, On
every fide, together were heard the sound of whips, and the groans of those
who were scorching in the fire3 together were seen the wheeIS, the collam,
the preffeS, and other instruments of torture. Chimaeratearing some, Cer-
berus devouriug others, all suffering th‘eir deserved punishment, kings and
ssaves, satraps and beggars, rich and poor, one with another. Not one
of them but repented of their crimes. Some of those, we obsta-ed, who
w‘ere but lately dead, hid themselves, and rctired from us, and, if by
chance we discovered them, looked sneaking and servile; those, particularly,
you may suppose, who in their life times were most proud and haughty.
The poor had half their punishment remitted, and, after intervals of rest,
were again chastised for their misdemeanors.

There did Ι see the famous Ixion, and Sisyphu5‚ and Phrygiam Tantalus,
in all his misery, and the earth-born Tityus: O Hercules, what an im-
mense creature! strerching himself over a whole field. Leaving these, we
came to the Acherusian Mead, where we found the demi-gods and hemines,
with another croud of ghosts, divided into nations and tribes, sorue old,
wither-ed, and, as Homer calls them, ἦ feeble ghosts. Others looked
youthful, and strong3 particularly your AEgyptian carcases, l suppose, from

ἃ Fachle ghosts] Νεκυων amma καξηναι. Pope calls thern wan ffiades, and feeble ghosts. See

the Odyffey, book x. Concerning the true sense of the epithetafasmvoe, the critics are much
divided.
