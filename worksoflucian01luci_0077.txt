TIMON. 41

P L U T U S.
You are in the right to keep me close by you; for, if you should set me

free, perhaps I might go astray‚ and blunder upon Cleon or Hyperbolus.
But what is this noise, like the clinking of iron upon a stone Ρ
Μ Ε R C U R Y.
It is Timon, digging up a piece of rocky land hard by us; and see
along with him is Poverty, and Labour, and Strength, and Fortitude‚ and
Wisdom, all driven thither by Hunger 3 a body-guard stronger, 1 am afraid,

than your’s. P L U T U S

Mercury, let us be gone immediately : we can do no good to a man that
is surrounded with such an army.

M E R C U R Y.
Jove thinks otherwise: therefore come along, and fear nothing.

P O V E R T Y.
Whither, Mercury, are you leading this friend of yours?

M E R C U R Y.
To Timon : we are sent by Jupiter.

P 0 V E R T Y.
Shall Plutus then come to Timon at last, after Ι have taken him under

my protection, corrupted as he was with Sloth and Luxury3 configned him
over to the wholesome instruCtion of Labour, and Wisdorn, and rendered him
a man of worth and eharad‘rer? Will you thus despise and affront me, as
to rob me of my only poffeffion, the man whom, with so much care, I had
formed to virtue3 to throw him into the hands of Plutus, who will soon
make him as idle and wicked as ever he was3 and, when he is good for
nothing, will give him me back again.

M E R C U R Y.
Such, Ο Poverty, is the will of Jove.

P O V E R T Y.
Then, I take my leave. Do you, Labour, Wisdom, and the rest of you,

follow me: soon shall he know the value of her whom he has lost, his best
friend and instruetor, with whom, while he dwelt with me, he enjoyed a
found mind and healthful body, lived as a man ought to live, and had an

eye upon his own condue‘c, looking on every thing else, as they really ατε,
as superfluous and unneceffary.
