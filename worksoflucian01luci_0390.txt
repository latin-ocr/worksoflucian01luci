fortune, we light on any thing valuable, we cannot be certain that it is what
we want3 so many things resembling each other, and every one pretending

to be thetruth.
H E R M O T I M U S.

Ι know not how it is, Lycinus, but your arguments seem to me to have
too much reason in them3 and to say the truth, you have given me no little
uneafines3‚ by scrutinizing things so nicely, where there was no neceffit-y.
Bad luck, Ι think, has attended me ever finceI left my house this morning,
and I was unfortunate in lighting on you, wh0, when 1 was just arrived at
the summit of my hopes, have t'hrown me back into doubt and uncertainty,
by almost convincing me that the investigation of truth is beyond our strength,
as it requires so many years to be masters of it.

LYCINUS.

You may as well, my good friend, blame your father Menecrates, or your
mother, whatever her name be, for I know not, or rather, indeed, human*
nature, for not making you as long lived as Tithonus, and circumscribing
us all in this manner within the short space of a century. Ι have only found

out what arose from our rational enquiry into the matter.

HERMOTIMUS.

Not su, Lycinus; you were always contentious, and, Ι know not why„
hate philosophy, and laugh at the professors of it.

LYCINUS.

My dear Hermotimus, you and your master, perhaps, who are philoso-
pherS, can best tell what Truth is; I only know that {heis not always agree-
able to those who hear her3 in her outward appearance Falsehood greatly ex-
cels her, whilst she, conscious of her ownv integrity, a&s towards all men
with boldness and confidence, and for that very reason they are angry with
her3 as you now are with me, for finding out the truth of this affair, and¹
declaring to you that what we both so much admiie is not easy to be ob-
tained : it is just as if you had fallen in love with a statue, which you mis.
took sor a fine woman, and hoped to enj'oy her, while I, who knew it to be·
nothing but brass or stone, with the best intention, endeavoured to convince¹
you that you could never get poffeffion of her, and then you call me ill-
natured and malevolent, for not suffering you to be imposed on, or to hope,

absurdly, for what could never be acquired,
