It is indeed: you see what hatred 1 incur by it, and what dangers Ι am

liable to: but l have another business also, the very opposite to that3 the
business I mean, of love, esteem, and approbation. I am the friend of
truth, of honour, beauty, of fimplicity, of every thing that is amiable and
good ; but few there are who deserve this love : whereas, of those who merit
my hatred there are millions. Thus, there is no little danger of lofing all
my skill in one profeffion, for want of opportunities to exercise it; and of

punish them. But, ifI should be overcome, and the black balls prevail,
O throw in thy suffrage, and preserve me.

Now, we are seated, and ready to hear your pleadings. Choose one
amongst you, who has the best hand at an accusation, to make out the in·
diermenm do you put your arguments together, and prove his guilt: but

you must not all speak at once. You, Parrhefiades, must afterwards endea-

vour to defend yourself.
