454 THETYRANT-KILLEK

and performed many brave adtions before I killed this youth. It was no
easy thing for any man to get through the wateh, to overcome the guards‚

and put so many to flight: these. were great and noble deeds, the killing the
tyrant himself was not so difficult a taik, as to get the better of all those who

defend and support him, when that is done the rest is easy3 but there was
no getting at him without first conquering those who were about him. 1 will
say no more, but rest my cause on this; Ι gained the fort, Iovercame the
guards, Itook away from the tyrant his support and defenee, and left him
naked and unarmed3 am not 1 '‘for this worthy of the reward, or will youx
still demand of me his life ? Nor even if you should demand this, shall it be
wanting3 I returned not bloodless, but made a great and noble ssaughter,
even a youth in the prime of life, one who was formidable to all, one to
whom he trusted every thing, and who alone was a better defence than all
his guards·, and after such and so many deeds as these, shall I remain dis-
graced and unrewarded? What ifI had ssain but one guard, what if I had
destroyed but one 'of the tyrant’s ssaves who was dear to hirn ; would it not
have appeared a great thing to you, if any man had got up into the tower,
and in the midst of all his guards, had ssain one of his friends? But behold
heis ssain himself, even the son of our great enemy, the most cruel tyrant,
the most implacable master, the most inhumari punissier, the most violent
oppressor of the two, and, what to us' was most dreadful, his heir and suc-
ceffor ; who alone could multiply and extend our calamities hereafter : sup-
pofing that this alone were done, and that the tyrant himself had escaped‚
and was still alive3 even for this only I demand the reward. What say ye?

will ye allow it me? were ye not in dread of him ? was he not your lord and
master ? was he not hateful? was he not intolerable?

Confider, therefore, and determine the affair ε what my adversary requires
of me Ι have performed ε l have ssain the tyrant by another ssaughter, not
indeed at one blow, which would have been to him far more defireable, but
after l had tortured him with grief, after I had placed before him all that he
held dear, a beloved son in the flower of his age, killed, and weltring in his
blood; this was the worst of wounds a father could feel, this· was a death
, worthy of the most crueltyrant, this was a punishment suitable to such ini-
quity: to have died immediately, to have been deprived at once of sense
and motion, without beholding such a spedtacle, would have been a mercy
which he did not deserve. Think not that I was ignorant, no man could be

so,
