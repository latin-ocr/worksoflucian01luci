cruel by such as do not consider the neceffity of this behaviour3 such as ex-
claim against the punishment of the offenders, without reflecting on their
crimes3 which is just as equitable, as ifa person, who should seea sacri-
ligious wretch thrown from the rock, by your orderS, should accuse you of
cruelty sor thus punissiing a Grecian‚ in a place so near the temple; never,
at the fiune time, remembering his guilt, or calling to mind that he had,
perhaps, entered the temple by night, stolen your offeringS‚ or even laid im-
pious hands on the statue of your god. Were a man, 1 say, thus ridicul-
oussy to asperse you, you would yourselves smile at the accusation, and all
men applaud your justice. In reality‚ the populace, who never weigh the
merit of him who governs, hate the name of a tyrant3 and, just or unjust,
they are at all events resolved to destroy him, even though he were an AEacus,
a Minos, or a Rhadamanthus· The evil actions of the bad are ever before
their eyes, notare the good (as the appellation of Tyrant is common to them
both), less subje& to their hatred and ill treatment. I have heard of many
wise and virtuous men, who, though they bore the name of tyrants, even in
the worst sense in which it is most generally received, have behaved with
the greatest mildness and humanity3 some of whose moral and sententious
maxims are now repofited in your temple. Lawgivers have ever looked on
punishments as absolutely necessary in a state 3- being persuaded, that with·
out the sear of them, affairs could not poffibly be carried on3 and, I am sa·
tisfied, to tyrants they are stin more useful, as we rule by force alone, and are·
perpetually obnoxious to such as hate and conspire against us; so tha-t ter-
rors of a lighter kind are of no effefii. lt is the sable of the Hydra; the ’
vmore we punish, the more occasions of punishment present themselves; one·
head is no sooner cut off, but another springs up to supply its place3 and we
are forced, like Iolaus, to burn, if we expe& to conquer. He, whose hard
fate it is to be engaged in such an undertaking, must be equal to it, or, by
sparing others, destroy himself. After all, what man can you suppose of so
cruel and inhuman disposition, as to hear the groans, and see the stripes of

another, unless he had the greatest cause to infiist them on him? How
often have Ι wepr, when others were beaten ? How often have I lamented

my own ill fortune, who bare thus myself the heauier afflictior] ? For surely,
to a man by nature good, and only cruel through neceflity, it was much*
harder to inruet, than to suffer punishment3, and l declare, were it my.
