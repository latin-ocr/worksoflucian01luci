ONDEPENDANTS. 305

These fine speeches feed you with hope, and you are soon brought over :
you that but a little before had dreamed of a thousand talents‚ whole acres,
and houses, begin to discover a little parfimony; you flatter yourself, how-
ever, with his promises, and suppose he must have been in earnest when he
talked of all things being in common between you: little thinking that
such things as these

ἧς Just touch the lips, but never wet the tongue.

At length, out of modesty, you submit it to him : he will deny, perhaps,
that he said any such thing, and referit to some friend who was present, de-
firing him to name a middle price, such as can reasonably be afforded by him
