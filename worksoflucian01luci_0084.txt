48 TIMON.

T I M O N.
So: here comes a third3 Demeas, the orator, with a deci-ee in his hand ε

he pretends to be one of my nearest relations. He was bound to the state

for sevenoeen ments, and, unable to pay it, was condemned, when Ι took
pisy on, and redeemed him3 and yet, when he was employed to distribute

the public money to our tribe, and Ι asked him for my {hare of it, he de·

clared he did not know I was a citizen.

D E M E A S.
Hail, Timon! the chief support of thy noble family, the defence of

AthenS, and the bnlwark of all Greece. The senate and people affembled
await thy presence ; but first hear the decree which I have drawn up concern-
ing thee:

“ Whereas Timon, the Colyttenfian, son of Echechratides, not only the

D E M E A S.

Your modesty is pleased to say so, but we should be very ungrateful to
forget your services. “ He hath, moreover‚ been ofno small advantage to the
state in drawing up decrees‚ in counesss, and in the administration of mili-
tary affairs ε wherefore, it harh seemed meet to the senate, magistracy, and
people here affembled, to all and every one of thern, that a golden statue
of Timon ssiould be placed in the AcropoliS, next to Minerva, with rays
over his head, and a thunder-bolt in his hand3 that he be crowned with
seven golden crowns: that this shall be proclairned at the theatre, by new

tragediam,
