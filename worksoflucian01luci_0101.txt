DIALOGUESO'F THE GoDS.

In the DIALOGUES oF THE Gons we meet with no incofflderable share of true wit and
humour. The Heathen Deities are here called in, hy turns, hy om· sprightlyſsxtyrst,
mere-ly to lazcgh at, and expose one'another ; and the whole absistas spstem of pagan
theology‚ which, about the time when thest’ Dialogues were written, was on the de-

cline, was perhaps total-ly dcstrcyed, and may be fiziel to have received ils coup
de grace from the raillerjy of LuchN.

MERCURY.

Yes3 Io, you mean.
J U P 1 T E R.

She is turned into a cow.

M E R C U R Y.
Surprifing! How happened it ?
⁶ J U Ρ 1 T Ε R.
Junoss, in afit of jealousy, thought proper to metamorphose her; and
withal‚ to make the poor creature more unhappy, has set one Argos, a herds-
man, with ahundred eyes, to guard her, who watches over her night and

day, and never sseePS.
M E R C U R Y.

What can 1 do to serve you in this affair ?
J U P 1 T E R.
Fly to the Nemaean wood‚ for there Argus feeds his cattle : kill him, and
carry her off to AEgypt: there 1et her be called Ifis, and worihipped as a
goddess, raise the Nile, send prosperous gales, and preserve mariners.

ὅ· Juno in a fit, &cd Lucian attributes the transformation of Io to Juno herself. ovid tells
the story differently, and informs us, that Jupiter turned her into a cow, to save her from the
resentment of that vindifflve lady.
