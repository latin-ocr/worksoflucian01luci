insolence! you will never have done laughing—But now to you, friend, for
you ·1 had rather talkbwith ε what is it you cry for?
H E R A C L Ι T U S.

Stranger, Ithink all the affairs of men deserve our lamentation ,and our
tears, nor is there any thing belonging to them that is not doomed to misery ;
therefore do 1 weep and lament. The present evil l hold not so great, but
those to corne are terrible indeed: the burning and total destruction of all
things. 1 lament that nothing is firm and permanent, but all mixed, as it
were, into one bitter porion, 74 painful pleasure, ignorant knowlege, great
is small, and high is low, for ever turning about and changing in the child-

hood of human life.

ἃ· Paz'nsulpleasure.] Τερψις meg-span. The followers of Heraclitus talked also of καφος annum,
ασοφοςσοφιοι, amen,- eve-Gna, with a hundred other quaffimeffes of the same kind, merely to
puzzle and perplex. Hippocrates, in h'rs treatise De Diaeta‚ gives a particular account of
Heraclitus’s philosophy, to which l refer my readers.

† Griphi.] The griphi were not very different from our riddles and conundrums, though they
required, perhaps, a little more learning to unravel them. See Athenaeus, book x.
