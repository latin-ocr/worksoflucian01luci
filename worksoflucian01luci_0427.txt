WRITING HISTORY. 391

nothing to do, (for no body employed him,) tucked up his robe, and, with
all his might, fell a-rolling his tub, which he lived in, up and down the
³⁸⁵ Cranium : What are you about? said one of his friends 3 Rolling my tub,
replied he, that whilst every body is busy around me, I may not be the only
idle person in the kingdom. In like manner, Ι, my dear Philo, being very
¹ loath, in this noisy age, to make no noise at all, or to a& the part of a mute
in the comedy‚ think it highly proper that 1 should roll my tub also: not
that 1 mean to= write history myself, or be a narrator of faits ; you need not
fear me, Ι am not so rash, knowing the danger too well ifI roll it amongst
the stones, especially such a tub as mine, which is not over strong, so that
the least pebble I strike against, would dash it in· pieces. I will tell you,
however, what my design iS, how Ι mean to be present at the battle, and
yet keep out of the reach of danger: 1 intend to ihelter myself frorn the
*ᾗ waves and the smoke, and the cares that writers are liable to, and onlygive
thern a little good advice, and a few precepts3 to have, in ihort, some little
hand in the building, though I do not expe& my name will be inscribed on
it, as Ι shall but just touch the mortar with the tip of my finger.

There are many, Ι know, who think, there is novneceffity for instruction
at all with: regard to this business, any more than there is for walking, see-
ing, or eating‚ and that it is· the eafiest- thing in the world for a man to write
history, if he can but say what comes uppermost ε, but you, my friend, are
convinced that it is no such easy matter, nor should be negligently and care-
lessly performed 3. but that, on the other hand, if there be any thing in the
whole circle of literature, that requires more than ordinary care and atten-
tion, it is undoubtedly this: at least, if a man would wilh, as Thucydides
says, to labour for posterity. 1 very well know, that I cannot attack so
many without rendering myself obnoxious to some, especially those whose
histories are already finiihed, and made public; even if, what Ι say, should
be approved by them, it would be madness to expe& that they ssiould re·
tra& any thing, or alter that which had been once established, and, as it
were, laid up in royal repofitories :¹ it may not be amiss, however, to give
them these instru&ions, that in case of another war, the Getae against the
Gauls, or the Indians, perhaps, against the Barbarians, (for with regard to

ἃ Granium]v A kind of school or gymnafium, where the young men performed their exer*
aises: the choice of such a place by a philosopher, to roll a tub in, heightens the ridicule.
