MENIPPUS.

NOW, AEaeus, by Pluto, I beseech you, lead me all round, and ssrew
me every thing worth seeing here below.

AE A C U S.
That cannot eafily be done, Menippus; but the most considerable are as
follows: this is Cerberus; to Charon, who brought you over, you are no

stranger3 Pyriphlegethon, and the great lake, you saw as you came in.

M E N 1 P P U S.
These 1 know already, and you, who guard the entrance3 Ι had a fight

also of Pluto and the Furies : but lhew me your old heroes, those who made
the greatest figure in the world.

AE A C U S.
Yonder is Agamemon, the other Achilles, hc who fits next to them is
Idomeneus; then comes Ulyfi'es, after him Ajax‚ Diomede, and several

other famous Grecians.
M E N I P P U S.

Alas poor Homer ! how the glorious subjed’ts of thy rhapsodies lie scatter-
ed upon the ground, without form or beaury, mere dust and affies, with
very ἥ poor heads, trifles now 'of no value or duration ε but who is this ?

AE A C U S.
Cyrus; and here comes Crassus, next to him is Sardanapalus, behind

them is Midas, and that is Xerxes. ’

Μ Ε Ν Ι Ρ Ρ U S.
Thou too, implous wretch, wert once the terror of Greecc, pretending to

sall through mountains, and building bridges over the Hellespont; and what
a figure is that Crassus now! but pray‚ AEacuS, let me give that Sardana-

palusabox.
AE A C U S.

By no means, you would eracl< that soft effeminate skull of his.

³ Poor heads.] Alluding to that expresfion of Homer in the Odyss‘ey,

Nexum αμηηνα napum.
