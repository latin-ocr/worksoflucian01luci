heartily for anthe mischief that can happen, that 1 may reap the benefit

ofit.
CHARON.

Indeed, Mercury, so it must be: you see I have very little company at
present, in time of peace.

M E R C U R Y.
And well it is s0‚ though it defers the payment of my debt. You must

remember, Charon, what sort of mortals used to come down formerly,
steht, able men, full of blood, and covered with wounds: now-a·days we
see none but old fellows made away with by their sons, husbands by their
wives, or poor wretches that died of dropfies, with bloated legs and bellies,

from high living, pale, and ghgstly, and not at all like our old vifitors:
most of these new-comers are sent to us by foul means, for the sake of their

money· c H A R o N.

Which, you know, is very defirable.
M E R C U R Y.
You cannot blame me, therefore, if I dun you a little for what you

DIALOGUEIII.

PLUTQMERCURY.

PLUTO.

DO you know that old follow, ³²* that very old man; Ῑ mean the rich
Eucrates, who has not one child to inherit his estate, but about fifty thou·

sand legacy-hunters gaping after it ?
M E R C U R Y.
O yes3 the Sicyonian, you mean. What of him?
P L U T O.

lwould add ninety more, let him add, if he can, as many more to that:

ἃ Yhat very old man, Εὔα] The practice of legacy-hunting hath been a fruitful and inex-
haustible obje& of ridicule and satire amongst wits‚ both ancient and modern, from the days οἱ

Lucian to those of Ben Jonson, who has, perhaps, treated it more fully and comprehenfively
than any of thern: the plan of his excellent comedy of Volpone seems to have been taken from

this dialogue.
