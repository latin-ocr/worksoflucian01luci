VULCAN Aur> APOLLO.

V U L C A N.
APOLLO, have you seen this new-born son of Maia ? the infant is ex-

ceffively pretty, smiles at every body, and seems to promise something very

great hereafter.
A P Ο L L Ο.

Very great, to be sure, Vulcan, and a pretty infant, who is older in mis-
chief than *Japetus himself.

V U L C A N.
Why, what mighty mischief can a child do that is just born ?

A. Ρ 0 L L .
Ask Neptune, whose trident he stole3 or chars, whose sword he drew pri·¹

vately out of his scabbard3 not to mention myself, whom he disarmed of

my bow and arrows.
V U L C A N.

What ! an infant, that is carried about in his swaddling—cloaths, do this !

A P O L L 0.
You’ll see, if he comes near you.

V U L C A N.
He has been with me already.

A P Ο L L Ο.
And have you got all your tools safe ? is nothing miffing ?

VULCAN.
Nothing. A P o L L o·

But look narrowly. V U L C A N

By Jove, I don't see my tongS.

A P O L L O.
You’ll find them in the child’s swaddling-cloaths.

³* Japetus, &eq Japetus was the son of Ouranus‚ and brother to Saturn. According to
Hefiod, he married Clymene, daughter of Oceanus, by whom he had four illustrious sons, At-
las, Menetius, Prometheus, and Epimetheus. He was considered by the Grecians as the great
father and founder of their whole race. History and tradition could not reach beyond him.
A very old man in his dotage was usually called Japetus. Etymologists say, he was the same
as Japhet3 and the similitude of found seems to favour this conjeuure.
