But surely, my friend, general satire‚. and true humour
(and these you are kind enough to grant me), stand as fair
a chance of general approbation as any other species of au·-
thorial merit can entitle us to·

LORD LYTTELTON.

That‚ Ι grant you, is a fair suppofition‚ and might have
its effect, were it equally true that delicate irony, like
your’S, were universally tasted and understood3 but, as my
friend fsrssram Shandy sayS‚ “ It is not in the power of
every man to taste humour, however he may wiih it3 it

is the gift of God.”
L U c 1 A N.

Humour‚ I grant yOU‚ is the gift of heaven, and sc,
for aught Ι know, may be a taste for it3 but you will take
this along with you, that whatever is poffeffed by few is
always affected, and pretended t0‚ by many: though not
one in a thousand has a proper and adequate idea of true
humour, yet every one puts in a claim to it: few, there-
fore, would willingly be thought totally unacquainted with,
or disclaim all knowlege of and acquaintance with νῆα es·-
pecially amongst you Englissimen, of whom humour is
said to be characteristic.

LORD LYTTELTON.

It may be [ος but the unlearned have never yet seen
you in a good English (hese, and our literati are too proud
or too idle to visit you in your own: they accuse you,
befides‚ of certain faultS, which it would ill become -me to

mention.

Ο pray‚ my Lord, be not scrupulous in that point; I

took the liberty but just now to censure your workS, and
