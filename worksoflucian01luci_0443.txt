WRITINGHISTORY. 407

ingnor with-holding from any, from favour, or from eumity‚ not influenced
by pity, by shame, or by remorse; ajust judge, so far benevolent to all, as
never to give more than is due to any in his work: a stranger to all, of no
country, bound only by his own laws, acknowleging no sovereign, never
confidering what this or that man may say of him, but relating faithfully·
every thing as it happened.

This rule therefore Thucydides observed, distinguishing properly the faults
and perfeitions of history3 not unmindful of the great reputation which He-
rodotus had acquired, insomuch that his * books were called by the names
of the Muses. Thucydides tells uS, that he “ wrote for posterity, and not
for present delight3 that he by no mean‘s approved of the fabulous‚ but was
defirous of delivering down the truth alone to future ages.'' It is the useful,
he adds, which must constitute the merit of history, that by the retro·
spestion of what is past, when firnilar events occur, men may know how to
“ a& in present exigencies.

Such an historian would Ι wish to have under my care: with regard to
language and expreffion, Ι would not have it rough, and vehement, confist·
ing of ψ long periods, or complex argument53 but soft‚ quiet, smooth, and
peaceable. The refleefions short and frequent, the style clear and perspicu-
ous: for as freedom and truth should be the principal perfeffions of the
writer's mind 3 so, with regard to language, the great point is, to make every
thing plain and intelligible, not to use remote and far-fetched phrases, or ex·-
preffions, at the same time avoiding such as are mean and vulgar: let it be,
in short, what the lowest may understand3 and, at the same time, the most
learned cannot but approve. The whole may be adorned with figure and κ

metaphor, provided they are not turgid or bombast, nor seem st'ffand la·
boured‚ which, like meat too highly seasoned, always give diigust.

Itis observable that this proverbial kind of expresfion. for freedom of words and sentiments, has
been adopted into almost every langmge, though the image conveying itis different. 'l'hus the
Greeks call a fig a fig, &c. We say, an honest man calls—a spade a spade3 and the French cau
un chat un chat.—Bo‘11eau says, j’appelle un chat un chat, and Rolet un fripon.

ἥ Books.] Herodotus's history is comprehended in nine books, to each ofwhicb is prefixed
the name ofa quse3 the fust is called Clio, the second Euterpe, and so on. A modern poet, I
have been told, the ingenious Mr- Aaron Hill, improved upon this thought, and chriftened (ir‘
we may properly so call it) not his books, but his daughters by the same poetical names of
Miss Cli. Miss Melp-y‚ Miss serps—y, Miss Urania, &c. '

ἦ· Loqueriods.] Both Thucydides and Livyare reprehenfible in this particulam and the same
objeetion may be made to Thuauus, clarendon, Burnet, aud many other modern historiae&
