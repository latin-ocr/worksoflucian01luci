known amongst us : I cannot confer a greater favour, than to introduce and

’ recommend you to him.

Let us not then delay, said Anacharfi53 bring us together, Ibeseech you,
ToxariS, as soon as poffible; but I sear he will be difficult of access, and,
perhaps, pay no regarcl to your recommendation. Never fear that, said
Toxaris, I know I {hall do him the greatest favour, by giving him an oppor-
tunity of ssiewing kindness to a stranger3 follow me, and you shall soon ex-
perience his hospitality, justice, candour, and benevolence3 and see, my
friend, as if sent by heaven's appointment, he approaches towards us; that
is he who comes this way, he seems wrapped in meditation, and is talking
to himself. ’

Toxaris then went up to Solon3 I have brought you, said he, a valuable
present, a stranger, who stands in need of your friendlhip and protectior&
a Scythiam by birth, who has left his country and family to live with us, and
see the wonders of Greece. 1 have pointed out to him the ssiortest way to be
acquainted with every thing, and every body worth knowing here, and for
this purpose Ι have brought him to you. 1f I have any knowlege of Solon,
I doubt not but he will treat him hospitably, pay him public honours, and
adopt him a citizen of Greece. Ι

And now (turning to the Scythiam), Anacharsis, he cried, you have seen
Solon, and in him every thing3 he is Athens; he is Greece3 you are no
longer a stranger here3 all men know, and all love you; so much depends
on this good old man3 living with him you will soon forget Scythia3 you
reap the reward of your travels, the great end of all your labour3 here you
see the Grecian laws, and the philosophy of Athens. Acknowlege yourself
at length the happiest of mankind, to be thus bleffed with Solon’s friend-
ssiip.

How much Solon was pleased with the present which Toxaris had made
him, and all that ᾖε said on the occasion, would be tedious to relate3 suffice
it to observe, that they afterwards lived together, Solon shewing him every
thing, instructing, and recommending him, taking every method to make
him live easily and happily in Greece : whilst Anacharsis, on his part, admir-
ed the wisdorn of Solon so much, that he would never stir from him3 for,
as Toxaris had foretold, from Solon alone, in a short time, he knew every
thing, became acquainted with every body, and was universally esteemed3
his approbation, indeed, was a matter os no little consequence, for all men
