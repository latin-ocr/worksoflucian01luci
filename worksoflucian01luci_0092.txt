ADIALOGUE.

In this little ίναέῗ, which is replete with wit and humour, LucIAN apparently con-
fiders the whole story of PRoMETHEus as an abficrd and ridiculousfable, and treats
it accordingl v, not without fiune severe strie‘tures on the whole system of Pagan

rescue3 nor must we place him quite at the top of the mountain, for then
he will not be seen by those who are below. We had better ‘fix him here,
1 believe, about the middle, just above this precipice, with his arms ex-

tended.
M E R C U R Y.

Good3 for the rocks here are broken, and inacceffible, inclining to the
preciplce, and so marrow, that you 'can hardly stand upright on it; the

the former has already been made use of.
