380 THESCYTHIAN.

pagite, saw, in the middle of the night, the figure of Toxaris standing by
her, and commanding her to tell the Athenians, that the pestilence would
cease‚ isthey sprinkled the streets of the city with wine; by repeating this
(for the Athenians followed the advice), whether it was that the smell aris-
ing from the wine dispelled the noxious vapours, or that ToxariS, who was
a ss<ilfzzl pli-isician, made use of any other means, the plague was stayed3 in
consideration os 1533, a white horse is annually sacrificed at his tomb, on the
spot where Dimaenete *rr-s supposed to have seen him, when he prescribed the
remedy, and where T oxaris was buried, with an inscription, at present scarce
legibile. There was likewise a small pillar, with a figure of Toxaris, who held
an out-stretched bow in his right hand, and in his left a book, both which
are still to be seen, though one half of the monument, and the face os the
man are destroyed by time. Not far from the double gate, and on the left,
as you go to the Academy, you will find the little tomb, and part of the
pillar lying on the ground3 it is always crowned with garlands, and * seve-
ral persons, it is said, by resorting to it, have been cured of severs ε nor is
this improbable3 as Toxaris formerly preserved the whole city.

It was during the life of Toxaris (and this is the reason why 1 mentioned
him) that Anacharsis came into Greece3 and when he landed at the Piraeus,
being a barbarian, and an utter stranger to the country, ignorant of every
thing in it, and not knowing what to do with himself, he suffered no little
uneafiness ε his dress and arms rendered him an object of derifion to the mul·
titude, and he could find no body who understood his language3 insomuch
that he began at length to repent of his journey, and resolved, though he
had but just set foot in Athens, to turn back again, sail to the Bospho-
rus, and make the best of his way home: in this situation, Toxaris, likea
good genius, met him as he entered the Ceramicus; attrasted by his foreign
habit, he carne up to him; it is, indeed, most probable that he must have
known Anacharfis, who was a man of the first rank in Scythia, though he
might not recolleet Toxaris, who was dressed< in the Grecian manner, with-
out a girdle‚ or a sword, close shaved‚ and, in short, appearing in all res·
pects as a native of Athens, such an entire change had time wrought in him.
Are not you, said ToxariS, in the Scythian tongue, Anacharfis, the son of
Daucetus? Anacharsis shed tears ofj0y‚ at thus meeting with a man who*
