head-quarters -She ‘²4 dances the Pyrrhic dance too, ssiakes her spear, and
seems inspired ; but, which is most extraordinary, she is exceffively handsome,

and seems already at years of maturity. She has blue eyes, and the helmet
sets her off to advantage. I intreat you, therefore, Jupiter, that you will re-
ward your midwife, by giving rne her hand.

DIALOGUE IV.

VENUS ANDCUPID.

V E N U S.

SEE, son Cupid, what work you make ε Ι do not mean what mortales, by
your instigation, do one among another upon earth3 but, by your pranks in
heaven, turning Jupiter into so many fflapes, just as occasion serves, calling
down the moon from her orb; making Phoebus forget his journey to stop

young men, not being fond of o'ld women, ssighted her. She resented the injury on his niis-
tress3 or, as* some writers say, on Atys himself, in the severest manner, as the reader may see,

if he turns to Catullus. Her priests are represented as lamenting his death. See Sophocles.
