108 DIAiLOGUESm: TanGODS.

A P O L L O.
I, for my part, have been always unfortunate in my amours: of the· two I

loved most, one ran away from me, and chose rather to be turned into a tree
than have any concern with me, and the other was killed accidentally by
myself, and now Ι wear garlands for them.

M E R C U R Y.
Once upon a time Venus was kind to rne3 but I lhould not brag of it.

A P Ο L L O.
lknow it: Hermaphroditus, they say, was the iffue of it: but tell me,
if you can, how happens it that Venus and Aglaia are not jealous of each

other?
M ER C U RY.

Because one dwells at Lemnos with him, and the other refides in heaven:
besides, Venus is engaged with Mars, and is fond of him3 {he troubles her

head therefore very little about this blacksmith.
A Ρ O L L Ο.
And does Vulcan know ir, think you ?

⁷ M E R C U R Y.
He does3 but what can he do? seeing his rival is a noble youth, and a

soldier too : wherefore he holds his peace3 though he talks, indeed, some-
times of making a net to catch rhem.

A P O L L O.
1 do not know any thing of that, but I am sure it is a net 1 should wish

to be caught in.

A P Ο L L O.
Tell me what it is, Ibeseech you, that I may laugh with you·-

M E R C U R Y.
Mars and Venus are caught together. Vulcan has caught them in a net0

APOLLO,
