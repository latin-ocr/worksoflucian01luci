ORACLEoFTnaDEAD. 189

*that I should fall, as they say, out of the ³¹ smoke into the fire ι for amongst
these, I found, in the end, only rnore ignorance and insufficiency, vand was
almost induced to think the life of an ideot preferable to their's. One main-
tained that we should follow pleasure, in which alone true happiness confist-
ed ; another enjoined perpetual toil and labour, told us, we should keep the
body lean, squallid, and emaciated; that we should be morose and severe3
and then would he chaunt forth the old verses of Hefiod, about virtue, and
sweating up to the ψ top of a high mountain. One exhorted us to contemti
riches, as a thing of no value, or estimation3 whilst another acknowleged

that Plutus himself had something good in him ι not to mention their strange
notion's about the world, their original ideas, incorporeal beings, atorns, a
vacuum„ and a heap of such unintelligible jargon, which they were per--
petually repeating ;v but of all things, the most truly ridiculouS, was, that
whilst they all held tenets and opinions diretfftly oppofite and contradiftory
to each other, every one supported his argument with such strong and power-
ful reasons, there was no refuting-either one, who said it was hot, or the
other, who affirmed it to be cold; though you were convinced it was im-
impoffible for the same thing to be both hot and coldvat the'same time. For
my part, ,Ι was like a man half asseep, affenting and‘diffenting, by a· nod, to
both parties. Ι could not, moreover, help observing, that, which was still
more absurd, in many of them, their pradiice was direflly contrary to their
principles :A those, I remarked, who inculc-ated the greatest contempt of

siches, were themselves so strongly attached to, that they were- not, by any
means, to be torn from them :- they quarrelled about usury, they taught for
hire, they went through every thing, in short, for the sake of money. Those,

in like manner, who were for extirpatingsshe love of fame, attempted every
thing from that very motive: whilst-all--united torrail at pleasure in public,

and, in private, thought of nothing else.
Thus, again, and again disappointed,- I grew very= uneasy, but comforted·-

ιν Out osthesmokc] An old Gfeek' proverb³ It is adopted by Erasmus; furnum fugiens (says-r

he) in ignem incidi. We have an English adageswhich borders nearly upon it. ‘⁶ Out of thei

frying-pan into the fire.’'
† qbp qfa high mountain.] Alluding' to those lines of Hessodr
The paths of virtue must be· reach'd‘by teil,
Arduous, and long, and on a ruggedssoil,
Thorny the path ; but, when the top you gain,

fair is the future, and the prospe& plain.
