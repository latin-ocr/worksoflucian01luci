WRITING HISTORY. 3³97·

. Befides this, after setting out in delicate Ionic‚ he drops, l know not
how, into the most vulgar style, and expreffions, used only by the very
dregs of the people. ¹ ·

And here 1 must not pass over a certain wise man, whose name, however,
Ι shall not mention3 his work is lately published at Corinth, and is beyond
every thing one could have conceived. In the very first sentence of his
preface he takes his readers to talk, and convinces them, by the most saga· v
cious method of reasoning, that “ none buta wisc man should ever attempt
to write history :'' then comes syllogism upon syllogism3 every kind of ar-
gument is by turns made use of, to introduce the meanest and most fulsome ,
adulation; and even this is brought in by syllogism and interrogation. What
appeared to me the most intolerable, and unbecoming the long beard osa
philosopher, was, his saying in the preface, that our emperor was above all
rnen most happy, whose aCtions even philosophers did not disdain tp cele·
brate : surely this, if it ought to be said at all, should have been, left for ηε,
to say rather than himself,

Neither must we here forget that historiam, who begins thus; “ I come·
to speak of the Romans and Perfians;'' and a little after he says, “sor the
Persians ought to suffer ;.'’ and in another place, “there was one Ostoes,
whom the Greeks call Oxyrrhoes-,'' with. many things of this kind. This
man is just such a one as him I mentioned before, only that one is like
Thucydides, and the other, the exac‘t resemblance of Herodotus.

But there is yet another writer, renowned for eloquence, another Thucy-
dides, or rather superior to him, who most elaborately describes every city,
mountain, field, and river, and cries out with all his might, “ may the
great avertet of evil turn it all on our enemies !’' This is colder than Caspian-
snow, or Celtic ice. The emperor's ssiield takes up a whole book to de·
scribe: the *Gorgon’s eyes are blue, and black, and white3 the serpents
twine about his hair, and his belt has all the colours of the rainbow ι how many

ἃ The Gorgon’s eyes, Εὔα]
His buckler's mighty orb was next display’d'‚·
Tremendous Gorgon frown’d upon its field,
And circling terrors fill’d th’ expressive shield ε
Within its concave hung a silver thong,
On which a mimic serpent creeps along,
His azure length in easy waves extends,

Till, in three heads, th’ embroider'd monster ends.
See Pope’s Homer’s Iliad, book xi. 1. 43,-

Lucian fiere means to ridicule, not Homer, but the historian's absurd imitation of him.
