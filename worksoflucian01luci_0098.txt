62 CAUCASUS.

would be nothing to compare them with; nor ssiould we so well know our
own happiness, without reflee'ting that there were some beings not pofl'essed
of it. The great can only be known by contrasting it to the little : and yet,
for my ingenious device and good counsel, you have thought fit thus to re-
ward me. But you will say‚'perhap3, these same mortals are wicked crea-
tures; that they go to war, commit adultery, marry their fisters, and affaffin-
ate their parents; as if we had not vices enough of the same kind amongst
ourselves; and yet heaven and earth are not condemned for producing us.
You may add also, that we have bufiness enough upon our own hands, to
take care ofthem; and, for the same reason, the shepherd might be angry
that he had a flock to look after3 it might belaborious‚ but atthe same time
it would be pleafing to him: such solitude is no disagreeable employment.
If we had no business, what ssiould we do with our time; nothing, but in·

could such have sacrifieed to the gods, or paid due honours to you? And

do you not, when they send up their hecatombs, run away to the utmost
limits of the world, to meet Pan, and the blameless &Ethiopians3 and

yet 1, who am the cause of all your honours and vietims, must be fixed on
a cross for it.

So much for the men ε and now pass we on to the fire and theft, which Ι
am aceused of: answer me, for heaven’s sake, this question3 is there less
fire amongst us fince 1 imparted it to men ? You will confess there is n0t3
for such is its nature, that it never diminishes by participation, nor is ex·
tinguished by another’s receiving light and heat from it: what is it then but
envy, to forbid the use of it, which ean do you no injury ? Gods should be
graeious and beneficent‚ the dispensers of good to all, without grudging or
discontent. Neirher‚ had I carried it all away, would you have suffered any
