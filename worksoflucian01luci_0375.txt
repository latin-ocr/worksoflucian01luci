HERMOTIMUS. 339

To this, Hermotimus, we should zealoussy apply ourse'lves, and cast away

every other care: if we could lay hold on such a country, neither parents
nor children, though with tears they intreated, should draw us from it; we
should exhort them to follow us in the same path; but if they were unwilling,
or unable, shake them off, and proceed on our journey to this bltffed city ;
tear off, and even leave our garment behind3 for from this place, though
naked‚ none are excluded. Ι remember well an old man describing this
place, and persuading me to follow him thither, telling me he would go
first, and when Icame. would make me a denizen of that city, and of his
tribe, and that there I ssxould live a life of perfect felicity. Ι, such was the
folly of youth, for it is fifteen years ago, did not follow him3 perhaps by
this time Ι might have been in the suburbs, or even at the gates of it. He
told me, Icall to mind, amongst many other things, that there all were
guests and strangers, not natives of the place; that many barbarians and
ssaves, many poor, little, and deformed were there3 that every one, in short,
who chose it, might be acitizen ; for the law was, that none should be ad-
mitted on account of his estate, his dress, or stature, his beauty, his family,
or the dignity of his ancestors; to these no deference was paid3 to the rank
of citizen nothing was necessary but wisdom, industry‚ the love of truth,
contempt of pleasures, and a mind that would not bend or yield, though at—
tacked by ever so many difficulties and dangers; poffeffed of these qualities,
whosoever he be, he is immediately admitted3 for the names of better or
worse, noble or ignoble, freeman or ssave, are never mentioned or thought

onthere.

Now, Lycinus, you see Ι had no little or triflng obje& in view when my
ambition was to become a denizen of such a noble, such a happy city.

LYCINUS.

Our pursuits then are the same, nor is there any thing which I more ar,-
dently wilh to obtain ; had it been near, and in fight of all men, l had long
fince 'been a citizen of i·t; but fince, as both you and Hefiod, that old rhap-
sodist, tell us, it is a great way off, we must endeavour to find out the best
«way, and the surest guide to it : should we not?

HERMOTIMUS·

The only meanS, no doubt of arriving at it.
