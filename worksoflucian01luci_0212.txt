ALEXANDERANDPHILIP.

P H I L I P.
NOW, Alexander, Ι suppose you will own yourself my son; for if you
had been Jupiter Ammon'S, you would not have died.

A L E X A N D E R.
Indeed, father, Ἰ always knew well enough that 1 was the son of Philip,
who was the son of Amyntas; but Ι laid hold on the oracle in my favour,
