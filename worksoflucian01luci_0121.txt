DIALOGUE XVII.

NEPTUNE ΛΝΒ THE DOLPHINS.

N E P T U N E.

WELL have ye done, my DolphinS, ye are always friendly to mankind3
witness your carrying Juno's son to the Isthmus, from the rocks of Scyron,
when he was thrown down from thence into the sea; and now you have
saved this harper of Methymna, swimming with him to Taenarus, harp,
garland and all, upon your backs; and would not suffer him to be torn to

pieces by the sailors.
D O L P H 1 N S.

Wonder not, Neptune, at our benevolence to mankind3 for we ourselvcs
were men, before we were turned into fifh.

N E P Τ U N E.
Bacchus, Ithink, was much to blame for transforming you thus, after

conquering you in a sea-fight3 he might have been satisfied with reducing·
you to obedience, as he did so many others. But how happened this affair

ofArion?
D Ο L P H 1 N S.

Periander, I suppose, was very fond of him, and, on account of his skill,
frequently invited him. At length, enriched by the king’s bounty, and now
on his return to Methymna, he boasted of the wealth he had acquired; and
being on board a veffel belonging to some worthless feHows, bragged much of
the great quantity of gold and filver which he had brought with him: when
they had got almost into the middle of the AEgean, they conspired together
against him, whereupon (for as I swam by the boat Ι overheard every thing):
“ If, says he to them, you are so determined‚ permit me at least to take my
garland, and, after finging you a funeral anthem, to throw myself overboard:
the failors consented3 and he, taking his garland, and singing them some
soft ditty, jumped into the sea, expecting to be drowned immediately: but
Ι took him upon my back, and swam with him to Taenartts.

N E P T U N E.
Your love of harmony 1 approve5 you have really paid him well for his

pi ping.
