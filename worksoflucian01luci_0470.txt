between Alexander the son of Philip, and Hannibal the Carthaginian, which
was given in favour of Alexander, who was placed on a throne next to the
elder Cyrus, the Persian. Our cause came on the last3 the king asked us,
how we dated to enter, alone as we were, into that sacred abode3 we told
him every thing that had happened3 he commanded us to retire‚ and con-
