SEA.

And why did he throw fite upon you?
X A N T H U S.

On account of Achilles. Ihad intreated him several times, but to no
purpose, to leave off ssaying the Trojans : still he went on, and stopped up
my channel with carcases, till, in compaffion to the poor wretches‚ I
threatened to clrown him with my waters, in hopes that the dread of it
would induce him to cease the ssaughter: when Vulcan‚ for he was near at
hand, rushed upon me with all the fire, Ι believe, he had, and all that he
could get from AEtna, and every other place, burned up my elms and
ssiruhs, and roasted my eels, all my poor fifh, made me boil, and was within
a very little of leaving me quite dry. You see what a condition I am in
with the flames.

ἃ Vastan, &c.] In the twenty-third book of the Iliad, Homer makes Achilles ssay so many
Trojms, that the river, who is represented as a god, in resentment of being so dissurbed,
overflows, and nearly overwhelrns the hero. Achilles applies to Jupiter, who sends Vulcan to
dry up the river. The sanguine admirers of Homer extol the sublimity of this conception:

the idea is, notwithstanding, undoubtedly autres, and borders nearly on the burlesque. Lu-
cian, it is plain, saw the ridicule of it.
