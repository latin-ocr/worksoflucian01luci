42 TIMON.

MERCURY.

They are gone 3 let us approach him.
T 1 M O N.

&Vho are you, rascals? and what do you want here? to disturb a poor
labouring man in his busmess: but you shall not return unrewarded, a par-
cel of scoundrels as you are, for I shall pclt you handsomely with these

stones..
M E R C U R Y.

Softly‚ good Timon, we are no mortals: this is Plutus, and I am Mer-
cury. Jupiter heard your prayers, and sent us to you: accept therefore of
hi} bountieS, cease from your labour, and be happy.

T Ι M O N.

If ye arc gods, as ye say, you will fare never the better3 for, know, 1 hate
both gods and men: and as for this blind wretch‚ whoever he is, Iwill cer·
rainly knock him on the head with my spade.

P L U T U S.
For heaven’s sake, Mercury, let us be gone for fear of accidents; this

fellow appears to meto be stark mad.
M E R C U R Y.

Timon, lay afide this savage dispofition3 embrace your good fortune, be
once more rich, the prince of Athens, and despisc the ungrateful wretches

who deserted you. '
T Ι M Ο N.

Disturb me not : 1 have no need of you: my spade is all the riches I de-
fire, and Ι ihall esteem myself the most happy of men if none will come

nearme.
M E R C U R Y.

And art thou thus divested of all humanity ? and must Ι

,÷· Bear this fierce answer to the king of gods?

Men, indeed, from whom thou hast received so many injuries, might be
hatefu13 but not the godS, who have been so indulgent to thee.'

T I M Ο Ν.
To you, Mercury, and to Jupiter, for your care of me, I acknowlege
my obligations5 but as for this Plutus, 1 will by no means accept of him.
