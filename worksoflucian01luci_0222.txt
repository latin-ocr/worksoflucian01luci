0R THE

ORACLE oF THE DEAD.

ADIALOGUE.

This Dialogue was undoubtedly dcssgned by LuchN as a Burlesque on the eleventh
Book of HOMER'S Odyffey, destribing the Descent of ULYssEs to the Infi’rnal
Regions, and to which it is observuble, the ancient Critics, have prefixed the sume)
T ille, viz. Νεκυομκντια, or the Book of Necromancy. There seems to he, likewistff,
throughout, a vfible Allufion to the Oracle of TROPHONIUS, and the ridiculous
Ceremonies to be obser-ved lgy all those who consulted it, as accurately and minute&
dest-ribed by PAUSANIAS.

MENIPPUS, PHILONIDES.

“ A1L‚'·>·÷ ye lov'd dom-S, ye well known manfions, hail!

Once more to light returned, with blithsome heart,
You I re-vifit ”

PHILONIDES.
Sureiy this must be the Cynic, Menippus: ifI know what Menippus’ss

are, it is certainly he3 but why this strange disguise3 what business has he
with a lion's skin, a cap, and a lyre ? Ι will make up to him. Menippus,

 

your servant, whence come you ? for, I think, we have not seen you in the

city this many aday. M E N I P P U S

“ Far from the gods, where gloomy Orcus reigns, -
In the dark regions of the dead, I come.’'

-PHILONIDES.
And so you stole from us, without our knowing any thing of the marten,

and now are corne to life again ι O Hercules !
