THE DISINHERITEDSON. 461

ssmuld be enquired int0, that sons should not be condemned unheard;
but that all should be submitted to an equitable and eandid‘ examina-
tion.

Since, therefore, the accusation alone isin the power of the father, and
it is in your's alone, Ojudges, to determine whether it be just and well-
founded3 the subjefi: of his present· resentment you need not at present take
into consideration, but first enquire whether he, who has already exercised
the paternal authority, availed himself of the law, and condemned his son to
banishment, can again exercise the same right, after he had taken off the
baniihment, and restored him to favour. 1 affirm that it would be the high-
est injustice thus to multiply children’s punishments,¹⁴ perpetuare their scats,
and repeat their condemnation, that the law should thus first coincide withae
the father's resentment, a little afterwards be totally relaxed, and then again
take place, turning every thing backwards and forwards at different times,-
j-ust as the parents ffiould think proper. lt is certainly right and equitable
that. a power of punishing should be lodged in the father3 but when he has
exercised that power according to the law, when he bassatisfied his resent-
ment, when, after that,. he has-changed his opinion of the offender, and re-
ceived him back as good and worthy, in-this opinion> he should remain, not
revoking his sentence, nor retracting his judgment. lt is impoffible to say
whether a child will turn out good or bad3 it is proper, therefore, that¹
those who bring them up should have the power of expelling suchas ast
in a manner unbecoming their birth and family, but when not compelled
by neceffity, but of- his own accord, a father shall receive a son, whose con-
du& he approves, how can he afterwards reverse his opinions, or what more·
power can the law allow him Ρ for thus would the legissator argue with you,
“ if he behaved ill, and deserved banishment, why did you recall, why did
y-ou take him into your house again? why did you abrogare the law ἒ You
were free, and at liberty to do it or not as youv thought proper. You are
not to rnould the laws according to your pleasure, or to make equity and
justice change with your opinion 3¹ to expe& that the laws shall take place
one moment, and be abrogated the next, or that thejudges shall fit only as
wstneffes, or rather ministers of your will, now punilhing, and now forgiv-
ing, just as you please to dire& them; at one time alone you brought your
children into the world, once you educated them, once, and once only,

you have the power of repudiating them, provided it be done just1y3 but-
