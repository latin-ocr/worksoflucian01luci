WRITING HISTORY. φς

own much to be wished for triumph, as things that must come to pass.
Thus prophesying away, he soon got to the end ofthe story. He has built,
moreover, a new city in Mesopotamia, most magnificently magnificent, and
most beautifully beautiful, and is confidering with himself whether he shall
call it Victoria, from vic‘tory, or the City of Concord, or Peace‚ which
of them, however, is not yet determined, and this fine city must remain
without a name, filled as it is with nothing but this writer’s folly and non-
sense: he is now going about a long voyage, and to give us a description of
what is to be done in India; and this is γ rnore than a promise, for the pre-
face is already made, and the third legion, the Gauls, and a small part of
the Mauritanian forces under Caffius, have already passed the river; what
they will do afterwards, or how they will succeed against the elephanrs, it
will be some time before our wonderful writer can be able to learn, either
from Mazuris, or the Oxydraci.  

Thus do these foolish fellows trifle with us, neither knowing what is fit
to be done, nor if they did, able to execute it, at the same time determined
to say any thing that comes into their ridiculous heads; affecting to be grand
and pompouS, even in their titles: of “the Parthian victories so many
books;'' Parthis, says another, like Atthis; another more elegantly calls
his book, the Parthonicica of Demetrius.

I could mention many more of equal merit with these, but shall now pro-
ceed to make my promise good, and give some instructions how to write
better. I have not produced these examples merely to laugh at and ridicule
these noble histories; but with the view of real advantages‚ that he ubo
avoids their errorS, may himself learn to write well ; θ(- if it be true, as the
logicians affert, that of two oppofites, between which there is no medium,
the one being taken away, the other must remain.

Somebody, perhaps, will tell me, that the field is now clesnscd and
weeded, that the briars and brambles are cut up, the rubbish cleared off,
and the rough path made smooth 3 that I ought therefore to build something
myself‚ to shew that Ι not only can pull down the structures of others, but
am able to raise up and invent a work truly great and excellent, which no-
body could find fault with, nor Momus himself turn into ridicule.

⁸ If it be, ζέω] This kind of scholastic jargou was much in vogue in the time of Lucian,
and it is no wonder he should take every opportunity of laughing at it, as nothing can be more
opposite to true genius, wit, and humour, than such pedantry.
