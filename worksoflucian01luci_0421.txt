ZEUXIS:

oR,

A N TI Ο C H U S.

This ssems to be another Oration, probably spoken by LUcrAN, before the stzme Affem-
bly, andin the stzme Place as the lqst, which he alludes lo in the fhst Senteme: the
Example of Znuxrs is extreme& appcfite to the Pmpose‚ as well as that of Atm-
OCHUs. Both the Stories are carious and entertaining.

AS soon as I was got home the other day, after having repeated my ora-
tion, several of my auditors came, (as I am speaking to friends, I may
venture to mention it,) embraced, and complimented me highly on the oc-
cafion: their extravagant praises made me bluss13 partly, indeed, for fear
that Ithould not hereafter answer their expeffi'cations ε what they principally
dwelt on, was the novelty of every thing I had said. W⁷hat an admirable
speech, they cried‚ how elever he must be at invention ! how wonderfully
new! They must surely have been greatly affeeted, or they would not have
flattered a stranger in this manner: the excess of their praises, to say the
truth, gave me no little uneafiness; and when they were gone, Ι said to my-
self, was there nothing in my writings worthy of commendatior] but the no-
velty of them? is there no judicious observance of ancient rules, no Attic
elegance, no art in the composition, no senfible refieetions, no style or beauty ?
Surely if there had, they would not have praised them thu5, for being strange
and uncommon z they might, after all, have been charmed principally with
this ς for, as Homer tells us,

Nove] laysdattra& our raviih’d ears.

And yet, not with this alone, but partly with the other perfeetions which

'rm ’γαρ αοιδην μαλλον επικλειες’ ανὸρωποι,
Ητις angori-mm ιεωτατη αμφιπεληται. Od. A'. l. 35 ῐ.

which Pope thus transsates,

— Novel lays attraet our ravish’d ears,
But old the mind with inattention hears.
