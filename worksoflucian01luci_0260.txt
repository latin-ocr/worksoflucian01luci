224 ONSACRIFICES.

they took the ssmpes, one of a goat, another of a ramjevery one, in short, ,
that of some beast or bird3 and that this was the cause of their appearing

in such forms to this day. Thus has it been written above ten thousand -

years agn, in the inner parts of the tenfiples.

With regard to the sacrifices amongst them, they are the same as the
otherS, except that they stand round, and weep over the νὶἑὶὶτη that is
ssain: others bury after they have destroyed it: but if Apis, the chief of
theirgods‚ dies, who is it that prizes their hair so much as not to cut it
offimmediatffly, and shew his nssked grief upon his head, even if he had
the purple locks of Nisus? Apis, you must know, is a god seleffted from
the herd, voted so for his excellency‚ being harsdsomer and more vener-
able than the common oxen. These tales are believed by the multitude,
who, want only an Heraclium, or Detmlociitu53 one to laugh at their folly,v ι

the other to deplore their ignorance.
