them any more, and no longer held in estimation the person who had pro-
eured them for him. The despised camel died, and the two-coloured man
was made a present of, to one Thespis, a piper, for finging a good song after
dinner. I wish my works may not be like the Egyptian camel, andthat they
are only admired for their gold and purple. The mixture of dialogue and
comedy, though both of them excellent models‚ will not render them com-

pletely elegant, unless there is a harmony of composition, with ajust sym-
metry and proportion observed in them : from two things, in themselves
beautiful, might otherwise arise something monstrous and unnatural, like
the well-known “f-² Centaur; a creature not very agreeable, but rather, if we
trust those painters who have represented their battles, riotS, and intempe-
rance, to the last degree odious and disgustful. Is it impossible then, out of
two good things to form one that shall be excellent, like that sweet mixture
which we have ofwine and honey ? by no means : yet would Ι not venture
to say this of my own performances, where Ι rather sear the beauty of both
parts may be spoiled by the mixture of them. † Dialogue and comedy
did never properly accord together from the beginning3 one walking alone,
or with a few chosen friends, held her private disputations in some obscure
reeess ; whilst the other, a votary of Bacchus, mingled in the public theatre,
sported to the found of the pipe, and delighted in gibes‚ ridicule, and laugh-
ter; sometimes, soaring aloft in anapaestic verses, would she laugh the fol-

lowers of dialogue to scorn, call them idle disputants, contemplatorS, and
so forth, scoffing at them with true Bacchanalian licentiousness; now exposing

them as ‡ air-walkers, and converfing with the clouds, now deseribing

* Centaur,] The centaurs are described to us as monsters of Thessaly, half men and half
horses; a fable which probably took its rise from the Theslixlians beingthe first people who made
the proper use of horses ; it is natural to suppose that such an appearance might convey to those
who followed them the idea of a monster, half man and half beast: a country 'squire always
on horsebaek is to this day little better.

† Dialogue and comedy,] This observation seems very strange and absurd to us, who have al-
ways considered dialogue as indispensably necessary to, and inseparable from comedy, which,
notwithstanding, if we look back to the rise of the ancient songS, we shall find, was no more
than asong to Bacchus, or afterwards, the single speech, or declfflnation, of one drunken acior,
besmeared with lees of wine3 whilst philosophy-dialogue was confined to the grave philo-
sophers, who disputed about very serious matters. Lucian's Dialogues, which he is here de·
sending, ‘nave certainly a dramatic cast, and his application of the vis comica to philosophie
matters, is that which, above all things, has secured him the universal approbation of latter ages.

Χ Air·walkers,] This allodes to Aristophanes’s cornedy of the Clouds, where philosophy is
severely ridiculed, as building castles in the air, disputing about trifles, &c.
