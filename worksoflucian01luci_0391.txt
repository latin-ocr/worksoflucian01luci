HERMOTIMUS. 355

H E R M O T 1 M U S.
So we are never to philosophize‚ but give ourselves up to ssoth and indo-

lence, and live the life of fools.
L Y C 1 N U S.

When did you hear me affert this? I never forbid your philosophizing : 1
only say, when there are so many paths, all leading to philosophy and vir·
tue, and the true one lays hidden from us, we should make a stri& examina-
tion, that out of many we cannot pick out the best, without trying all, which
seems to be a tedious experiment: how then, I ask you once more, will you
aet? Will you follow the first who comes in your way, and philosophize
with him, and shall he, by some propitious Mercury, make his market of

r>
you. HERMOTIMUS.

lt is impoffible to answer you, whilst you deny that any man can jud-ge
for himself, unless he could live as long as a phoenix, to go through the
universe, and prove every thing: neither will you believe those who have
tried the multitude, whose consent bears witness to what they approve.

L Y C I N U S.

But who is this multitude ? Does it confist of those who know and have
experienced all things? Jf they are such men, one alone will suffice. Ι ast<
not for many of them: but if it is of the ignorant alone, their multitude
will never induce me to believe them3 when, knowing only one thing, ct
perhaps nothing, they pronounce decifively on all.

HERMOTIMUS.

You alone can spy out the truth ; and all befide3‚ who pretend to philoso-

phize‚ are fools and madmen.
L Y C 1 Ν U S.

Hermotimus, you asperse me cruelly; for never at any time -did 1 assume
a superiority over others, or place myself amongst the wise and learned. You
forget what Ibutjust now told you, that Ι never pretended to know more of
the truth than any body else, but confeffed that, with them, Iwas igno-

rantofit.
HERMOTIMUS.

It may be right to go round to all, to enquire into their several tenets and
opinions, and from thence to determine which is the best; but surely to
affign so many years for every experiment is ridiculous, as if from a few

,one might notjudge of a11; something of this kind appears to me to be very
Z z 2 Ι easy,
