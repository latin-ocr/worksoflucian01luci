deity3 sor Iam convinced, if I can clear myself in your opinion from the
imputation of cruelty, so falsely laid to my charge, Ishall stand acquitted
before all mankind. To the truth os what I affert Icall god to witness,
whom no falssiood can impose on, or man deceive. Mortals may be delud-
ed3 but from god, and above all, from our god, no secret can lie hid.
Sprung from one of the noblest families in Agrigentum, liberally educat-
ed, and versed in all the polites arts of Greece, [soon became popular in
the city, and in the administration of public affairs behaved with the utmost
equity and moderatiori towards my partners in the government3 nor in the
early partos my life was Ι ever accused of cruelty or oppreffion, of a re-
proachful, or obstinate disposition. But when Ι perceived that those, who
differed from me in their sentiments of public affairs, were plottiug against,
and endeavouring by all the means in their power to destroy me, and, in
consequence of this, a diffenfion arose amongst the citizens, I found that
the only method of providing for the security, both of myself and the com-

convinced of the neceffity of such a resolution. With these to affist me, Ι
could not fail of success· They raised no more disturbance‚ andI poss'efsed
myself of the supreme power. All complaints were immediately filenced3
but no banissiments, ssaughters, or proscriptions were ever exercised, even
on the conspirators, though such necefl'ary exertions of authority are gene-
rally made use ofin the first establissiment of a tyranny. But 1 had reason to
hope that by acts osmercy and generosity, and an equal distribution of re-
wards, Ι should, with more than ordinary facility, bring them to obedience3
and therefore, mutual pledges being given on each fide, I laid by all ani-

mofities with my enemies, and even made use of most of them as my friends
and counsellorS.

By the negligence of the magistrates the city was almost ruined ; the pub-
lic treasury openly plundercd. I adorned it with magnificent buildings, se-
cured it with walls, repaired the aqtieduc’tS, and encreased those revenues
which still remained to the state. The young men I took under my inspec-
tion, supplied the neceffities of the old, and attached the people to my in·
terests by public shexvs, feasts, and largeffes, The corruption of our youth,
the deflowering of virgins, the carrying away other men's wives, the send.-
