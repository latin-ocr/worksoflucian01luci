TIMON. 33

I have not, for a long time, turned my eyes towards Athens; never, in-
deed, fince philosophy and dispute became so rife among them3 insomuch
that their fighting and squabbling made such a noise and clamour, that I
could not hear the prayers of mortals, so that Ι was forced either to shut
my ears, or to be torn in pieces by those who bellow out about virtue,
incorporeal natures, and Iknow not what. Hence it happened that this
man escaped me, though he ought by no means to be neglee‘red. G0,
therefore, Mercury, to him immediate1y3 take Plutus along with you,
and let him carry a large treasure : let both remain with Timon, and not
leave him so easily as they did before, though, from his generosity, he
should again endeavour to turn them out of doors. As to those ungrate-
ful parafites, I shall think about thern hereafter, and reward them accord-
ing to their merit, as soon as Ι have repaired my lightning; for two of
my best rays were blunted the other day, which Ι launched with a little
too much vehemence against the sophist aa Anaxagoras, who was persuading
his followers that there were no gods. I mifled him, indeed, for Pericles
held out his hand to prote& him3 the thunder-bolt fell upon the temple of
Castor and Pollux, set it on fire, and split it all in pieces. Their punish-
ment, however, in the mean time, will be sufficient in seeing Timon made
rich again.

How necessary it is to be impudent, clamorous, and importunate3 not
to lawyers only, but to every one that has any thing to ask ! Behold this
Timon, from a beggar becomes a rich man3 he has got Jupiter over to
his fide, merely by dint of clamour and abuse; whereas, if hc had con-
tinued digging, and said nothing, he might have dug on for lise without be·
ing taken any notice of.

Jupiter, I'll not go near him.

ὅ· Anaxagoras,] This philosopher, who, in an age of ignorance, had some imperfecft idea of
the true God, held, in oppofition to the received opinion, that the world was governed by an
eternal and omnipotent Spirit. For this he was accused, by the sophists of his time, of atheism
gudidolatry. Pericles, the famous orator, strenuoussy defended him. Lucian's image of Ju-
piter’s striking at him, and, on Pericles' turning off the blow‚ setting the temple of Castor and
Pollux on fire, is, to the last degree, humorous and severe·
