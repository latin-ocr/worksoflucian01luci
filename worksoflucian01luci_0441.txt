hands will do nothing3 whereas, if there be a master, we quickly learn,

and are soon able to play by ourselves.
Give me a scholar, therefore, who is able to think and to write, to look

with an eye of discernment into thingS, and to do business himself, if called
upon, who hath both civil and military knowlege3 one, moreover, who
has been in camps, and has seen armies in the field and out of it, knows
the use of armS, and machinos, and warlike engines of every kind3 can tell

what the front, and what the horn 15, how the ranks are to be disposed‚
how the horse is to be dire&ed, and from whence, to advance or to retreat3

one, in short, who does not stay at home, and trust to the reports of others· :
but, above all, let him be of a noble and liberal mind3 let him neither fear
nor hope for any thing3 otherwise he will only resemble those unjust judges‚
who determine from partiality or prejudice, and give sentence for hire3 but,
whatever the man is, as such let him be described3 the historian must not
care for Philip, when he loses his eye by the arrow of ’κ Aster, at Olynthus,
nor for Alexander, when he so cruelly killed Clytus at the banquet : Cleon
must not terrify him, powerful as he was in the senate, and supreme at the
tribunal, nor prevent his recording him as a furious and pernicious man3
the whole city of Athens must not stop his relation of the Sicilian ssaughter,
the seizure of † Demosthenes, the death of Nicias, their violent thirst, thc-
water which they drank, and the death of so many of them whilst they were
drinking it; he will imagine (which will certainly be the case), that no man
in his senses will blame him for recording things exaetly as they fell out3
however some may have miscarried by imprudence, or others by ill fortune,
he is only the relator, not the author of them3 if they are beaten in a sea-
fight, it is not he who finks them·, if they fly, it is nothe who pursues
thern3 all he can do is to wish well to, and offer up his vows for them3 but.
by paffing over, or contradifi‘dng faits, he cannot alter or amend thern. It
would have been very easy, indeed, for Thucydides, with a stroke of his
pen, to have thrown down the walls of Epipolis, sunk the vessel of Hermo-
crates, or made an end of the execrable Gylippus, who stopped up all the
avenues with his walls and ditches, to have thrown the Syracufians on the

Lautumiae, and have let the Athenians go round Sicily and Italy, according

‘ Astera] See Diodorus Siculus, lib. vii. and Plutarch.
† Demosthenem] concerning some of these fads, even recent as they were then with regard
to us, historians are divided. Thucydides and Plutarch tell the story one way, Diodorus and

Justin another. Well might our author, therefore, find fault with their uncertainty.
