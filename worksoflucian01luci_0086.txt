O my poor shoulders l
Τ 1 M 0 N,

No bawling‚ or 1 will give you another. lt would be a comical jest in-
deed, if 1, who unarmed as I am, have cut off two battalions‚ as you told
mejust now, could not make an end of one poltroon like you. Issrould
have been conqueror in the Olympic games to very little purpose indeed.
Bur, who is this, is i't not Thrasycles the philosopher? most affuredly it is he,
with his long beard, and arched eye—brows, muttering something to himself,
his hair curled over his forehead, a Titanie aspect, and looking like an·
other ²* Boreas, or Triton, painted by Zeuxis. This fellow, if you meet
him of a morning, shall be decently cloathed, modest and humble in his
manner and behaviour, and will talk to you by the bour about piety and vir-
tue, condemn luxury and intemperance, and praise frugality3 and yet when
he comes to supper in the evening, and the waiter brings him his large cup,
(for he loves a bumper), then will he, as if he was drinking the water of
Lethe, forget every thing he had said in the morning, and a& in dire& op-
pofition to it ς devour every thing before him, like a hungry kite, croud his
neighbour with his stretched-out elbows, and lean upon the dissxes, as if he
expected to find the virtue he talked so much of, at the bottom of thern:
picks ont all the dainties‚ and seldom leaves a morsel of the ἦ* oglio behind
him ; always complaining ofhis bad supper, though the best part of it gene-
rally falls to his strare: after which he gers drunk, the natural consequence
of his gluttony, dances, fings, and scolds, and abuses every body: always
talkative in his cups, and even when he is so intoxicated as to be laughed at
by the whole company, will harangue to them about temperance and so-
briety: This, perhapS, is succeeded by a puke3 then is he carried away
from table with both arms clinging round one of the fidlers. Even whilst he

is sober the most sordid, impudent‚ and lying fellow upon earth, the mean-

* Boreas‚] Timon compares Thrasycles to Boreas, or Triton, probably from his conse-
quential appearance, puffing and blowing, so as to resemble the god Boreas when he blows, or

a Triton when he sounds his trumpet.
τ Ogli0‚] In Greek μυτἺωτΒ, a kind-of strong fauce, according to the scholiast, made of gar-

tick, leeRs, cheese, cil, and vinegar.
