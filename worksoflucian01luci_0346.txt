for fear one of the eunucha should observe your glances, and another, per»
haps, reprove you for gazing where you ought not.

At length you leave the feast, and go to bed, from whence roused at the
2cock·crowing, you get up, and cry out, what a poor miserable wretch am
I! doomed thus to quit my old companions‚ and employmcnts‚ that sweet
sseep, which I could indulge in as long as I pleased, my free and uncontrol-

bring on a consumption, shortness of breath, pains in the bowels, or, perhaps,

a Like the lion, δικ] Alluding‚ perhaps, to the story of Androclus, told by AElian and
others. Postea, says Gellius, videbamus Androclum'et leonem loro tenui revinelum, urbe to-

ζ Ο;’ἰ.] Alluding to the custorn of the combatants in the Palaestra, who always prepared for
the gymnastic exer-cises by rubbing their limbs with oil. The parasite dependant confines it to
the knees for a very obvious reason.
