and trust in none but those who herd with them, and them only. In a word,
therefore, whilst it remains still a secret which is the best sec't in philosophy,

Ι am resolved not to follow any one3 as that would be an affront upon all

therest.
HERMOTIMUS.

By Vesta, Ῑ intreat you, Lycinus, let Plato, Aristotle, EpicuruS, and all
of them rest in peace, I shall not contend with them: but let you and I,
my friend, enquire by ourselves whether there be not in [ruth such a philo-

arithmeticians to know whether it be so, or whether somebody else does not
say that they make five, or seven ? or do you not see immediately that he

must have told you truth ?

Plato's and Pythagoras’s ffiould affirm it.

L Y C 1 N U S.
This, Hermotimus, is nothing to the point in question: you compare
things which all rnen agree in, to things which all men differ about: did
you ever meet with any one who said that two and two made seven or eleven?
