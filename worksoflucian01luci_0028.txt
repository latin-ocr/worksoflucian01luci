have his * own word for it. Ileave them therefore to be transsated by
the author of the Efl'ay on VVoman, the Meretriciad‚ or any other gentle-
man of that class, and in the mean time can affure my readers, that they
will lose nothing by the omiffion of them.

† Ψευδοσοφιςης ε Σολοικιςης; Pseudosophista, or Solaecistas

This is a Dialogue between Lucian and a man who makes or repeats so-

lecisrns.
It is impoffible, except by chance, to render a Greek solecism by an

English one, that ssiall entirely correspond with it. Ι have not transsated
this Dialogue, therefore, for the same reason that Ι offered for not transsating
the Lexipliane3‚ and which, 1 hope, may pass for agood one, viz. that it

is tmtras'fialable.

Ωκυπες 3 or, Ocypus.

This Dialogue‚ ,ἶ Lucian has informed us, is none of his, being only a
dull and aukward imitation of the Tragopodagra, which wants no foil to
set it off. 1 could never, therefore, persuade myself to take the unneceffary
trouble of transsating it.

Resides these, two οι· three indelicate passages are omitted, which the rea-
der will find taken notice of in the course of the work. The rest of Lucian
is faithfully transsated in the following pages, and submitted, with all defe-
rence‚ tothejndgment of the public.
