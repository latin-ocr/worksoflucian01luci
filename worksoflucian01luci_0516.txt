or Phoenicia, the people of Italy, or the inhabitants of the northern climates
enjoy. We abound in riches and in happiness, and are revered by all, next
to our God3 this has been our glorious lot even to this day, and may it ever
‘reniain so. No one, Ι believe, can call to rnind a time⁸ when any man was
by us prohibited the offering up sacrifices or gifts; to which it isdoubtless
owing that the wealth> of our temple hath so wonderfully increased. Neither
at present, therefore, should any innovation be made, or any law enac‘oed,
contrary to the wisdom of our ancestors3 nor are the gifts offered to be so
nicely examined, or inquiry rnade whence and from whom they come, but
immediately received and consecrated3 that so we may pay our duty to our
god, and his pious worshippers. In these circumstances therefore, ODelphians,
you will, 1 think, a& most prudently, by giving a serious attention to the
great importaneet-of this business. No less than our god himself, his, tern-
ple, and his sacrifices, vour ancient rites and custorns, the glory of the oracle,
our future prailJe og infamy, and lastly, the interest of the whole city, and of
every individual in it, are now under consideration 3 which you cannot but
own, on reflection, to be of the utmost consequence. Our debate is not up-
on the tyrant Phalaris only, or this bull; but upon all those kings and great
men, who reverence this sacred temple; all the gold, filver, and other pre-
cious things, which shall at any time hereafter be dedicated. If we are to
determine according to the will of Apollo, why should we not a& in the
same manner we have always done 3 without setting afide our ancient consti·
tutiori, through a fondness for novelty3 and a desire of introducing a ridicu-
lous practice of subjecting those, who offer up gists, to our scrutiny and in-
spectiom a practice utterly unknown to this city finc‘e the foundation of it,
fince the Pythian first gave oracles, the Tripos spoke‚ or the priests were
inspired? You perceive how our temple is enriched3 that every one gives
something, and many even beyond what they can afford; whereas, if you
set up yourselves as censurers and enquirers into the merit of every gift, I
much fear our posterity will not have many offerings to boast of 3 and no one
would make himself appear guilty, or put himself to a considerable expehce,
with the hazard of being condemned, and brought into the greatest danger ;
for who indeed could bear even life itself under 'the ignominy of being pub.
licly adjudged unworthy to offer upa present to Apollo?
