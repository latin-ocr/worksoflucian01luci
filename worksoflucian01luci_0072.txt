3⁶ TIMON.

away thies, and laid by the beels ?

And yet, after all, you have no reason to be so angry3 for they are
all of rhem sufficiently punistied. The one, like Tantalus, neither eat
nor drink, but stand, with their mouths open, catching at their beloved
treasure. Whilst the other, like r Phineus, see it snatched out of their
jaws by harpies. But get away now to Timon z you will find him, by this

time, quite another man.

1 shall only run through his wicker basket3 he will pour me ‘out faster
than I can fiow in, as if he was afraid I should overwhelm him. Ι may
as well get into the Danaid's tub, as into a veffel that will hold no li-

But is he does not fill up these gaps, and stop the current, when it is
all run out, he may chance to find his blanket and spade at the bottom
of the cask. But, away with you, and make him rich once more. Do

get to him. Xtheas, when I take my leave, I have wings swifter than
abird3 no sooner are the doors unbarred, than, like a conqueror in the
sace, 1 ssy over the whole course at a leap, and am scarce seen by the spec-
tators.

'¹‘ Phineum Phineus was a king of Thrace ; he married Cleopatra, daughter of Boreas, by
whom he had two sons, Plinippus and Pandion ; growing tired of his first wife, he repudiated
ber to make way for another, who persuaded him to put out the eyes of his two sons. The

gods punissied him for this crime with blindness, and moreover gave him up to the harpies· to
be tormented by them.
