216 CHARON‚&c.
MERCURY.

It must, indeed, be so: but let us get down; put these mountains in
their places again, and away, Ito my bufinesS, you to your boat. 1 lhall
be with you soon, on my old errand.

CHARON.

Mercury‚ you have highly obliged me, you shall be enrolled amongst
the great ³* benefa&ors, and 1 will set you down amongst my best friends,
for helping me to this agreeable tour. What wretches are these mortals l
kings, hecatombs‚ battles, riches, are all they talk and think of: but not
a syllable of Charon.

³* Bean'ac‘lors] The word εωργιτης, or benefae'tor, was frequently used in public inscriptions,
coins, statues, διε.
