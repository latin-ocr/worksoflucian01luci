you any wrong, and justice condemns me, l am content to suffer the puniffl-⁴
ment deservcd: and you will do no violence. If, on the trial, I shall be

found innocent and irreprehensible, the judge will aequit me, and you will
turn your resentment towards those who deceived‚ and fet you against me.

What! turn the θ(- horse into the field; so you may deceive the judge5‚
and escape. It is well known you are an able orator, a subtle pleader, and
rather too knowing in disputation ε what judge can we have whom you will

of us; we, more especially, who profess ourselves lovers of equity: what
shall we say of Anytus and Melitus, of my accusers, or of my judges, if
