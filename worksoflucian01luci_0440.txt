404 INSTRUCTIONS Fon

1 say, therefore, that he who would write history well must be poffefl‘ed of
these two principal qualifications, a fine understanding‚ and a good style:
one is the gift of nature, and cannot be taught3 the other may be acquired
by frequent exercise‚ perpetual labour‚ and an emulation of the ancients.
To make men senfible and sagacious‚ who were not born s0, is more than l
pretend t03 to create and new-model things in this manner, would be a glo-
r'ious thing indeed; but one might as eafily make gold out of lead, filver‘
out of tin, a ἤτ’ Titornus out of a Conon, or a Milo out os a Leotro-
phides.

What then is in the power of art or instruction to perform? not to create
qualities and perfections already bestowed, but to teach the proper use of
them: for as ψ Iccus, Herodicus, Theon, or any other famous wrestler,>
would not promise to make Antiochus a conqueror in the Olympic gameS,
or equal to a Theagenes, or Polydama33 but only that where a man had
natural abilities for this exercise, he could, by his instruition, render him a‘
greater proficient in it: far be it from me also, to promise the invention of*
an art, so difficult as this, nor do I say that I can make any body an historian 3„
but that Ι will point out to one of good understanding, and ¹who has been
in some measure used to wrsting, certain proper paths (if such they appear
to him), which if any man shall tread in, he may, with greater ease and
dispatch‚ do what he ought to do, and attain the end which he is in pur·
suit of.

Neither can it be here asserted, be he ever so senfible or sagacious‚ that he r
doth not stand in need os assistance, with regard to those things which he is
ignorant 0f; otherwise he might play on the flute, or any other instrument,
who had never learned, and performjust as well; but without reaching, the

³* A Titornus, ἕω] Milo, the Crotonian wrestler, is reported to have been a man of most
wonderful bodily strength, concerning which a number of lies are told, for which the reader,
if he pleases, may consult his diCtionary. He lost his life, we are informed, by trying to rend
with his hands an old oak, which wedged him in, and preffed him to death. The poet says,

 

he met his end,
Wedg’d in that timber, which he strove to rend.

Titornus was a rival of Milo's, and, according to AElian, who is not always to be credited,
rolled a large stone with ease, which Milo with all his force could not stir. Conon was some
ssim Macaron} of that age, remarkable only for his debility, as was Leotrophides also, of crazy
mernory, recorded by Aristophanes, in his comedy, called the Birds.
