DAMASIAS.

Now, you see, I am thoroughly stripped, and of the ame fize with tny

brother shades here.
M E R C U R Y.

How light and easy you are now! come along. You, Crates, too, must
lay afide your riches, your luxury, and effeminacy3 nor must you bring the
epitaphs made upon you, nor your glory, nor your genealogy‚ nor the dig-
nity of your ancestors; neither must we have the public praiscs of the city
you so highly obliged, nor the inscriptions on your statue, nor the pornpous

sepulchre ereeted for you : even so much as the recollection of these things
is enough to weigh the boat down.

C R A T E S.
If I must, I must: what i's to bc done?

M E R C U R Y.
What do you do with annom, and what are these trophies for ?

C R A T E S.
Because, Mercury, I am a conqueror, and bave done noble deeds, there·⁴

fore did the city reward me with these honourS.

M E R C U R Y.
Leave your trophies on earth: here below we have always peace, and
arms are of no use. But who is this, in that grave and solemn habit, so proud
and haughty, wrapt in meditatim, with a long beard, and contrasted

bmw?
MENIPPUS.

Some philosopher, I warrant you, some juggler, full of portents and
prodigies: strip him by all means, you will find something purely ridicul-
ous under that cloak of his.

M E R C U R Y.

First, then, off with that habit, and then every thing else. O Jupiter,
what ignorance, impudence, and vain—glory! what a hcap of ambiguous
questions, knotty disputes, and perplexed thoughts does he carry about
him! what a deal of fruitless diligence, solemn trifles, and small talk!
Away with your riches, your pleasures, your anger, your luxury, your effe-
minacy‚ for 1 see it all, though you endeavour to conceal it; your falshood‚

pride, and high opinion, which you have of yourself: should you come with
all these, a five-oared bark would not be sufficient to carry you.
