horn, and drink the milk of birds ε for the labours thou hast gone through,
what rewards ssiould’st thou not inhesit! not of leaves alone should be thy
garland : no small or contemptible presents art thou entitled to, such as no
doubt should be paid without difficulty, and whenever you stand in need of
them, besides honours and dignities above the vulgar3 now you may expe&
relief from all your toils and labours, your ditty walkS, and waitings; the
happiness which you wished for, of stretching your feet, and sseeping at
your ease, doing nothing but what you at first agreed to do, and which alone
you were hired to perform. Nor for this, Timocles‚ would it be any great
hardship to bear on your shoulders a light and easy yoke‚ and what is more,
a golden one too; but the truth is, a great deal is still behind, and, indeed,
every thing: for, even when you are got into the family, there are a thou-
sand circumstances highly disgustful to the free mind. Confider within

as coming last is a mark of pride; carefully‚ therefore, observing the true
medium, you nick the exa& time, are ushered in, and defired to fit down
on the great man's right hand, and close to two of your old acquaintance.
And now, as if you had got into the palace of Jupiter, you begin to stare
and wonder at every thing about you, for it all appears new and strange:
the family fix their eyes upon you, ard the company watch your every
affion3 the great man himself is not unobservant of it, for he has already
told the servants to mark how you behave towards his wife and children,
and whether you frequently cast your eyes upon, and admire them. The
attendants laugh at your confufion, and conclude, from the aukwardness of
