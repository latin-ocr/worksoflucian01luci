Aye, and had got off too, if that brawny fellow there with the club had
not helped me to catch and bind him. All the way he came, from the
time when Atropos delivered him to me, he struggled, and hung back, held
fast by the earth, and could scarce be dragged along; sometimes would en-
deavour, by supplications, and mighty promises of what he would give, to
persuade me to let him go for a little while : but Ι, as it was my duty, re-
mained inflexible, when he asked what was impoffible to be granted. As
soon as we came to the mouth of hell, where AEacus, according to custom,
called over the dead, from the list which your fister had sent him, all on a
sudden we discovered that the rascal had stole away, one of our shades was

wanting3 when AEacus, frowning severely at me, cried, Mercury, you must
not praffise your thieving every where, you have played tricks enough al·
ready in heaven, we are more regular and exa& here below, nor can things
be so eafily concealed3 the account, you see, says, one thousand and four,
you have brought me one less; and now, I suppose, you will tell me it is
the mistake of Atropos. Blushing at this speech, and recollecting what had
passed on our journey, I looked about for my king, and finding he was de-
camped, pursued him as fast as Ι could, in the path leading towards earth;
my good friend there, of his own accord accompanied me, till, running
like prisoners broke out of goal, at last we overtook him just at '²⁶ Taenarus:
so near was he getting clear away from us.

And 311 this while, Charon, we were blaming Mercury for it.

But what do we wait for now ? We have had delays enough already.

Very true3 let them come aboard. I will take my book, as usual, fit
on the ship’s ladder, marl< them down as they enter, and enquire who they
are, and. whence they come, and what they died of3 do you, Mercury, put
them together, and sort them: throw me in those children first who cannot

give me an answer.
