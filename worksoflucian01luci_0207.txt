RH-ETORICIAN.
There, I have put them down.

M E R C U R Y.
It is well: now cut your cable, let us weigh anchor‚ and hoist our sails.
Charon, mind the belm: away, let us be merry. What do ye cry for, ye
fools? Imprimis, you, Mr. Philosopher, without the heard there?

PHILOSOPHER.
Because, Mercury, I thought the soul had been immortal.

M E N Ι Ρ Ρ U S.
He lies: he grieves for another reason.

MERCURY.

What?
MENIPPUS.

Because he shall have no more grand suppers; because he shall not, as he
used, steal out of an evening unperceived by any one, wrap his head up in
his cloak, take his rounds to all the bawdy·houses, then give his lectures in
the morning, make the young men admire his wisdom, and take their money:
this is the cause of his grief.

PHILOSOPHER.
And pray, Menippus, are not you sorry that you are dead l

Μ E N Ι P P U S.
Who I, that came hitber as soon as I could, and ἥ without calling: but

hark! do notI hear a noise, as if some mortals we left behind were making

a disturbance?
M E R C U R Y.

They are s0, and in more places than one: some are making themselves
· merry at the death of Lampfichus 3 the women are got round his wife, and
the boys throwing stones at his children : some are hallooing Diophantus,
the rhetorician, for his funeral oration on Crates; and there, by Jove, is
“ the mother of Damafias, crying and lamenting the loss of her son : but no-
body, Menippus, weeps for you: who alone seem to rest in peace.

M E N 1 Ρ Ρ U S.
Never fear; you will soon see the dogs barking after me, and the crows

ssmking their wings, when they meet, to bury me.

θ Withoutcalling] Diogenes Laertius informs us, that the philosopher Menippus hung
himself.
