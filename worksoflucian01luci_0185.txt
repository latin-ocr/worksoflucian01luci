DlALOGUESor THEDEAD. ¹49

or labourer to some needy rustic, who had scarce bread to eat, than be a
monarch here below: such words had suited well a low Phrygiam ssave,
anxious after long life3 but for the son of Peleus, the first of heroes, who
had courted so many dangers in the field, to think so meanly, and so much
beneath himself, is Ihameful indeed, and directly opposite to all his former
noble actions: for, when you might have reigned at Phthiotis, and lived
inglorious, even to extreme old age, you preferred an honourable death.

But then, O son of Nestor, Iwas ignorant of this state, and knew not
which was best: therefore did Ι prefer that idle farne to 1ife; at length 1
have discovered how unprofitable it is. On earth, indeed, such deeds as
mine are loudly celebrated, but amongst the dead all are equal: no longer,
Antilochus, have we strength or beauty, but are all involved in the same
obscurity, and not distinguiihable one from another; nor Trojan ghosts are
afraid of, nor Grecian revere Achilles ι one shade is like another, and the
coward and the brave are here mingled together 2 this is what disgusts me,
and Ihad much rather live and be a ssave on earth.

What is to be done? it is the law of nature that all must die, you should
submit to it therefore, and not repine: you see how many os your friends
are already here: Ulyffes too, will join us soon. Let it then afford you com-

fort, that you are not the only sufferet: behold Hercules, Meleager, and
other excellent men, who, Ι believe, would not willingly return to the
other world, if they expefted to be sent thither to be in a state of servitude,
under the low and indigent.

A C H I L L E S.

It is a friendly admonition : and yet, Ι know not how it is, but the nie-
mory of my past life still disquiets mc, and 1 cannot help thinking that
every one of you is affe&ed in the same manner: and if you will not acknow-
lege it, you are but so much the more to blame, in suffering without com·

plaint.
ANTILOCHUS.

Rather say, Achilles, we a& more prudently than yourself3 as well know·

opportunity to turn the blind bard into ridicule, has severely censured him in many plac-es for
propagating such absurd notions; though Homer, after all, was not to blame, as he only de·
livered the opinions and rables received and believed by his contemporaries, which was all the

busmess and all the dury of a poet.
