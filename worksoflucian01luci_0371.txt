HERMOTIMUS. 335

H E R M O T Ι Μ U S.
Ι will tell you·‚ 1 saw numbers adhere to her, and therefore concluded she

must be the best.
L Y C I N 'U S.

How many more were they than the Platonists and Epicureans? For, 1
suppose, you counted them, as they do at eleetions.

H E R M Ο T 1 M U S.
1 never counted them3 Ι only gueffed.
L Y C I N U S.
Surely you clo not mean to instru&, but to deceive and hide the truth
from me, when, in such an affair as this, you go by numbers and guess-

work.
HERMOTIMUS.

It was not that alone which determined me3 but Ι heard every body say, the

ν Epicureans were squeam'tsh voluptuaries, the Peripatetics sordid and litigi-

ous, the Platonics proud and vain-glorious3 but the Stoics, numbers ac-
knowleged, were brave and all-knowing‚ and he who followed thern was the
only wise, the only rich man, the only * king, was, in short, every thing

that is defireable.
L Y C Ι N U S.

Did other people tell you this? for, 1 suppose, you would hardly have
given credit to such as only praised themselves.

HERMOTIMUS.
By no means ε Ι had it from many others.

L Y C Ι N U S.
Those who embrace a different opinion, the followers of other se6't5‚ and

there are many, could never tell you so.

HERMOTIMUS.

No, certainly. L Y C I N U S

You had it then from the ignorant and illiterate.

HERMOTIMUS.

Maybe so.
L Y C 1 N U S.

Mark now how again you endeavour to impose upon me, as if you were

’¹‘ King.] Horace describes the perse& philosopher exaftly in the same manner,
