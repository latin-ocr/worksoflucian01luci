twenty myriads of years, bearing burthens, and driven by the mon,
after which they may be at liberty to die. Baldpate, the son of Skeleton,

inhabitant of Ghostland, and of the tribe of the Bloodless, proposed this
Decree.''

The Decree being read, the magistrates gave their votes, the populace
held up then· handS, Proserpine howled her consent, and Cerberus barked;
for thus, whatever is proposed here, must be confirmed, and made valid.

Ι have told you every thing that pafl'ed in the afl'embly; and now, ad-
dresfing myself to Tiresias, whom l went down in search of, Iacquainted
him with all my doubts and difficulties, and begged him to inform me
which he thought the best rule of life ; he smiled, and replied (for it is a
little blind animal, with a feeble voice), “ child, I know the cause
of all your perplexity is, that your wise men are never agreed among rhem-
selves about this matter: but I must not instruct yon, it is forbidden by
Rhadamanthus.'' Say not so, my little father, cried I, but tell me, do not
leave me as blind as yourself with regard to this life. He then took me
afide, a good way off from the croud, and gently whispered in my ear:
“ Thelife of plain unlearned men is the best and wisest: wherefore, laying
afide the folly of searching into sublime truths, and speculating on ends and
principles, no longer swallowing the sophisms of the learned, but looking on
thern as idle trifles, seek after this alone, to manage as well as you can the
present hour, and what lies before you3 pass eafily through life, laugh at
most things, and be nor solicirous about any.''

When he had said this, he retreated to a beautiful meadow, thick planted
with asphodelus3 whereupon, for it was now late, come, said Ι, Mithrobar-
zanes, what should we stay any longer for? let us return to the upper world.
Take courage, replied he, my friend, for I will shew you a ihort and easy
way up: and immediately he led me to a path, darker than that which wc
were in, and, pointing to a small glimmering light, at some 'distance from
us, tha· {hot as it were through a cranny‚ that, says he, is the temple of
Trophonius, from which the Boeotians come down3 get up there, and you
will soon be in Greece. Rejoicing at the news, 1 embraced my good ma-
gician, and crept along, with some difficulty, through the mouth of the ca·
vern, and here 1 am, l know not how, in Lebadia.
