THEFISHERMAN.- 263

a laufthter-loting god, and rejoices, perhaps, in this kind of diverfion.
But this man, with malice prepense, and after long preparation, calls all
the great people together, makes up a large volume of abuse‚ and, with a
founding voice, pours it forth upon Plato, Pythagoras, Aristotle, Chrysip-
pus, myself, and all of you, without any specious excuse of a public festi-
val, or the least provocation from us; had he been injmed, indeed, it had
been more pardonable: but, which is worse than all, he pretends to do these
things in your name, and, taking Dialogue, our intimare friend and ac·
quaintance, makes use of him as a brother-attor, and fellow-cornbatant
against us. Moreover, he has prevailed on our companion, Menippus, to
join in farces with him : you will please to observe, that he alone, of all our
companions, is not here to asfist in the accusation, but has betrayed the
common cause, and absented himself on purpose.

For all these crimes, most noblejudges, it is meet he should suffer condign
punishment. What, indeed, can he say in his defence against the proof of so
many witneffes? Befides, that it will be right to make an example of him, and
deter others from the like contempt of Philosophy hereafter: whereas, if you
quietly submit to the injury, it will be deservedly called, not temperance
and moderation, but indolence and folly. For who would bear such an af·
front as the last which he put upon us, when he brought us into the marker-
place, like so many ssaves, appointed a crier, and sold some of us for an
Attic mina, some for more; me, in particular, the rascal disposed of for
two oboli, to the no small diverfion of the speetators. These, O Philoso-
phy, are the reasons of our returning thus to earth, to ss1ew our indignation
against him, and, affronted as we have been, to request that you will re-
venge us.

P L A T O.

Well argued, Diogenes 3 you have said every thing, and most excellently,

that could be said for every one of us,

PHILOSOPHY.

Let us have no encomiums, but ‘⁵5⁶ pour in for the defendant. Parrhe-
fiades, it is your turn to speak: your water flows n0w3 therefore, without
farther delay, begin immediately.
