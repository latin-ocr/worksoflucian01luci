220 ONSACRIFICES.

soon filled heaven with his offspring3 some of celestial breed, others of ter-
restria13 most benevolently transforming himself into a bull, or a swan, or
an eagle, or a ssiower of gold : more changeahle than Proteus himself. How
he begot Minerva alone, out of his own head, and conceived her in his
hrain: as to Bacchus, we are told, who was snatched, half-formed, from

his burning mother, he hid him in his thigh, and when the labour-pangs

were over, cut him out again.
Something of the same kind do they sing concerning Juno, that, without
knowlege of man, she brought forth Vulcan, whom she conceived by the

ἥ wind, that unfortunate dirty black·smith, a dealer in brass and fire, living
in perpetual smoke, surrounded with furnaces and flames, short os one leg,
and lame from the sall he received, when Jupiter threw him out of heaven 3
if the Lemnians, indeed, had not kindly received him, there would have
been an end of our Vulcan, who had perished like Astyanax, thrown from
the tower. All this is tolerable: but who has not heard of Prometheus, and
what he untlerwent, for loving mankind too well! and how Jupiter sent
him to Scythia, hung him upon mount Caucasus, and placed a vultur near
him, to feed every day upon his liver.

He has suffered sufficiently. Rhea too (for this likewise should, perhaps,
be mentioned); how indecently did she acl, and unworthy of herself, an old
woman, as she is, and worn out, the mother of so many gods, to love the
boys, to bejealous, to put the lions to her car, and take her Attis about
with her3 one, besides, who can be os so † little service.' If these things
are so, who can be angry with Venus for her adulteries, or Luna for stop-

ping so often half way to meet her Endymion?
But, to say no more of this, let us take poetical licence, and get up at
once into heaven, by the same road as Homer and Hefiod travelled thither,

and see how every thing above is adorned and beautified. That the outfide

matters of fa& It is told likewise of Spanirh mares. This idea gave rise to an excellent pam-
phlet, published some few years ago, abounding with wit and humour, under the title of Lu-
cina fine Concubita, to which I refer my readers, if it is now to be purchased.
