252 TnnFISHERMAN.

P L A T Ο.

Assz thyself, villain, what thou hast done3 ask those ³* fine books thou
hast written, where thou hast traduced Philosophy herself, and {hamefully
abused us; purting up to public sale philosophers, and, what is more, free-
rnen: incensed at this, as well we may be, we have got leave of Pluto to
leave the infernal manfions3 Chrysippus here, and Epicurus, and myself,
and Aristotle, and filent Pythagoras, and Diogenes, and all those, whom
thou, in thy writings, hast so inhumanly torn to pieces.

L U C Ι A N.
Now I begin to breathe again3 for I am sure you will not kill me when
you know how I have really behaved towards you·‚ therefore, throw away
your stones, or rather, if you please, keep thern for those who deserve thern

better.
P L A T Ο.

Nonsense : 1 tell you, die you must, and this very day,

† Prepare for death, thy deeds have well-deserv'd it.

L U C I A N.
'And would you, good men as you are, kill your familiar friend, one who

wishes you well; one whom you ought rather to commend, who thinks with
you3 one, who if it is not too much arrogance to boast of it, may be called
the patron and promoter of your studies, and has laboured so much in your
service. Take heed you do not a& like the philosophers of these our days,
who are angry with, and ungrateful to, the man who has deserved every

thing from them.
P L A T O.

What impudence ! as if we were indebted to you for your abust, and you
really thought you were converfing with ssaves, and all your calumny and
reproach, it seems, is a favour conferred upon us·

L U C 1 A Ν.

Where, and when, have Ι ever abused or reproached you ? Ι, wh0, through
all my life, have praised and admired philosophy; always extolling you, and
studying your works ε whence have I borrowed every thing 1 say, but from
you? tasting, like the bee, your fiowers, and producing the honey to man·
