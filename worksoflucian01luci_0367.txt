HERMoTrMUS. 331

H E R M O T Ι Μ U S.
Ι know who you mean ; his name is Dion.

L Y C Ι N U 8.

The same. This· man, because, Ι suppose, he had not paid him the
money due in proper time, did he drag before a magistrate, seizing him by
the collar, and roaring in a most violent paffion; and if some friends, who
happened to come by, had not delivered the youth out of his hands, I verily
believe the old man would have bit his nose off.

H E R M O T Ι M U S.
That Dion is a bad man; he was always ungrateful, and ssow in his pay-
ments ; my master never acted so to any body else; for they generally pay

him when it is due.
L Y C Ι N U S.

And if they did not, my good friend, what would it fignisy to him who

know, all cares of that sort behind him on ἦ mount Oeta.

H E R M Ο T Ι M U S.
Can you imagine it is on his own account that he troubles himself about

these things? No, my friend3 he has small children, and his care is for
them, lest they should come to want.

L Y C Ι N U S.
He should have brought them up to virtue als0, that they might enjoy the

same happiness as himself, and be able to despise riches.

H E R M Ο Τ Ι Μ U S.
At present, LycinuS, I really have not time to dispute this matter with

you, for 1 am this moment going to his lectures, and am afraid Ι shall be

toolate.
L Y C Ι Ν U S.

Give yourself no trouble, my good friend, on that account: you need
not proceed any farther3 for there is a suspenfion of arms.

HERMOTIMUS.

What do you mean ?
L Y C 1 Ν U S.

That you will not see him this time, if we are to give any credit to his
proclamation; a bill is put up at his door in great letters, informing us that

ἱ· Mount Octa.] Alluding to the comparison made a little before, by Hermotimus, of the re-
treat of Hercules to mount Oeta».
