476 ORATIONQF PHALARIS·

and for what use3 and immediately opening the back, if, says he, you
would punizh any one in an extraordinary manner, cast him into this bull,
and when he is shut up close within it, order some pipes to be fastened to the
nostrils, and fire to he kindled beneath3 the wretch within will then roar out
through incessant pain, sending forth a mournful dirge of lamentable bellow·
ings through the pipe53 and, during his tortures, you will be entertained by
the music of them. Shocked at the invention of such a machine, Ι could
not but detest the contriver of it; and resolved to punilh him as he deserved.
Pennus, said Ι, to verify the truth of what you have asserted, enter first
yourself, and satisfy us whether there be, in reality, that harmony in the
instrument, which you have so much boasted of; receive the just reward of
thy ingenuity, and let the master of the rnufic give us the first song. He
obeyed3 and being shut up, the fise was kindled, and thus was his industry
repaid. But, lest by dying there he should pollute so noble a work, l or-
dered him to be taken out yet alive, thrown down from the rock, and his
body left unburied.

The buu, after expiation, I sent hither, as an offering to your god ;. com-
manding the whole history to be wrought upon it; viz. my own name,
that of the artist, his advice, my justice, and the proper punishment in-
flieted on him; with an account of the horrid eries of the cruel inventor,
and the experiment he made of his own mufic. You will a& therefore, Ο
¹Delphians, as becomes the priests of Apollo, if you will dedicate the bull
to him in your temple, and sacrifice for me; that all men may know how
Ia& towards the wicked, and in what manner Ι avenge myself of their
cruelty. By this have I sufficiently ssiewn my natural temper. Perilaus
was put to death, and the bull offered to Apollo3 not reserved to torture
others; nor did it ever bellovv forth the eries of any but the detestable in-
ventor of it, on whom alone Ι tried it, and put an end at once to such bar-
barous and inhuman mufic. This is all which Ι can now present to you.
Hereafter, when by the affistance of that god, to whom this is dedicated,
I shall have no more enemies to punish, Iwill bring other, and much
larger gifts. This, O DelphianS, we were authorised to deliver to you,
from our master Phalaris3 which we have done, with the strietest regard to
truth and justice. We are worthy to be believed, as you can yourselves bear
witness of our veracity3 and we have, on our parts, no reason to delude,
