ing soldiers into private houses, the insolencc of imperi-'us mttslers, and the
like, 1 ever looked upon with the utmost abhorrencc. At length 1 resolved
with myself to lay down the tyranny, and employed my thoughts wholly on
the properest method of procuring ease and retirement during the rest of my
life; for to hold the supreme power, and take the whole burthen of affairs
on myself was, 1 found by experience, a cruel task, which could only sub-
jcc‘t me to envy, labour, and anxiety. 1 even endeavoured to establish a
commonwcalth, and to free the city, for the future, from that arbitrary
power, which Ι had myself possessed. Whilst 1 was delib.rating on this,
those very men, whom 1 had before pardoned, entered into a new conspi-
racy against me; consultcd privately about the execution of it, raised arms
and money; begged the affistance of the neighbouring state53 and even sent
embaffies into Greece to the Athenians and LacedaemonianS, proclaiming

fool, and that it better became a manly mind to rescnt the injury, should
1 not secure my future safety, by revenging myself on my enemies?
This, doubtless‚ is the advice you would have given me; and how did 1
⁸ behave? 1 summoned the criminals before me, produced the articles laid to
their charge, and on the fullest examination, when they were not able to
deny their guilt, 1 punished them deservedly3 not so much on account of
their conspiracy against my life, as because they had, by that means, put it
out of my power ever to execute the defign 1 had proposed. From that time
1 have been always obliged to surround myself with guards, and to punish
with the utmost vigour every attempt against me; and therefore am Ι styled
