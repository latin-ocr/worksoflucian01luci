{- Harmony ⁰f the uru'vmfi, ζέω] Pythagoras afferted that the world was made according to
mufical proportion 3 and that the seven planem, betwixt heaven and the earth, which govem
the nativities of mortals‚ have an harmonious motion, and intervals correspondent to mufical
diatoniCS, rendering various sounds according to their several heights‚ so consonant as to make
the sweetest melody, or what we call the harmony of the spheres. He likewise told us, which
we may believe or not as we think proper, how many stadia there are betwixt the earth and
every star ; from the earth to the moon is 12600 stadia, and that distance, according to mufi-
cal proportion‚ is a tone; frorn the moon to Mercury, half as much, or a hemitone3 from
thence to Phosphorus (the star Venus), another hemitone3 from thence to the sun, a tone and
ahalf: thus the sun is distant from the earth, three tones and a half, or diapente3 from the
moon, two and a half, or diatessaron3 from the sun to Mars, one tone, from thence to Jupi-
ter, a hemitone 3 from thence to the highest heaven, another hemitone ; from heaven to the sun,
diatessaron 3 and from heaven to the top of the earth, fix tones, or a diapason concord: he re-
ferred, moreover, to other ssars, many things which the ancient muficians treat of, and held
that all (he world was enharmonio. See Stanley's Life of Pythagoras.
