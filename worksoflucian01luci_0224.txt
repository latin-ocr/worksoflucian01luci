188 MENIPPUS30R,·1·H12

PHILONIDES.

For heaven’s sake, Menippus, be less reserved to an old friend, who,
you know, can keep a secret, and, befides, is one of the initiated.

MENIPPUS.

It is a difficult task which you enjoin me, and not altogether safe: to
oblige you, however, Ι will venture. The decree is, that those rich rogues,
who keep their gold shut up, like Danae in

 

PHILONIDES.

Before you proceed with the decree, Ι must beg you, my good friend, to
let me know, what, above all, 1 desire first to be acquainted with, the cause

of your journey down, and who conducted you thither3 and, moreover,

what you saw and heard there3 as I am satisfied a man of your taste could
have omitted nothing that was worthy of his observation.

MENIPPUS.

This too I will do for you : when a friend is so obligingly preffing, there
is no denying him. First, then, Ι must acquaint you with my sentiments;
and what it was that determined me to vifit the infernal regions. When a
boy, lwas always reading Homer and Hefiod, who recounted the battles
and factiuns, not only of their heroes and demi-gods, but of the gods them-
selves, their tapes, adulteries, quarrels, banishing their parents, marrying
brothers and fisters, and so forth·‚ all which, no doubt, I inserted, must be
right and honest, and which, to say the truth, 1 had no small desire to prac-
tise: but when Ι came to man’s estate, I attended to the laws, which
taught me a system of morality very different from that of the poets 3 that
Ι must not steal, stir up factions and seditions, nor commit adultery. Ι re-
mained in doubt and uncertainty, and knew not how to aet: the gods, I
thought, would never have been quarrelsome, factious, or adulterers, if they
had not thought it right so to be3 nor, on the other hand, would the legis-
lators have taught things directly opposite to these, if they had not thought
them more conducive to the welfare and happiness of mankind. ln this
doubtful state I remained, till it occurred to me, that I might apply, to cer-
tain persons, called philosophers, yield myself up to their dire6tion, and re-
quest them to point out to me that safe and simple path of life, which Ι
ought to follow3 thus resolved, Ι went in search of them, little thinking
