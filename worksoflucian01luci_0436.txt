What he tells us ofSevcrian, and which he swears he heard from those
who were eye-witneffes of it, is, no doubt extremely probable3 that he did
not chuse to drink poison, or to hang himself, but was resolved to find out
,some new and tragical way of dying; that, accordingly, having some large
cups of very fine glass, assoon as he had taken the resolution to finish him-
self, he broke one of them in picces, and with a fragment of it cut his
throat·, he would not make use of sword or spear, that his death might be

To complete all, because '¹‘ Thucydides made a funeral oration on the
heroes who fell at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, he also thought
something should be said of Severian : these historians, you must know, will

with the war in Armenia3 our writer, therefore, after burying Severian
most magnificently, places at his sepulchre one Afran’ms Silo, a centurion,
the rival of PericleS, who spoke so fine a declamation upon him as, by
heaven, made me laugh till Ι cried again, particularly when the orator
seemed dceply afflid'ted, and, with tears in his eyes, lamented the sumptu-

and, as it became the noble Afranius, before all the afl'embly, kills himself
at the tomb : so, Mars defend me l but he deserved to die much sooner, for
making such a declamation : when those, says he, who were present behel-d
this, they were filled with admiration, and beyond measure extolled Afra-
n1us: for my own part, 1 pitied him for the loss of the cakcs and dishes
which he so lamented, and only blamed him for not destroying the write-r
