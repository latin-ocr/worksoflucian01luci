PROMETHEUS.

A, the sime tehen this EPISTLE (fbr fitch it appears to be) was written, the Dia-
logues of Lucum havsng, we may steppofi', engaged the general attention, a certain
fizpercilious critic, who it seems was a lawyer, partly perhaps from resentment of
LucmN’s having quitted the bar, ahused, and, amongft other r flefiions, had called
him PRoMErHe us, probahgy coaficiering that species of dialogue,for which he was
so eminently dsstingassyed, as a kind of creation of his own. Y his answer‚ abound-
ing in agreeable aad playful raille7y‚ contains a defince of that manner of writing
which Luc 1AN had adopted, and maystrve to convince my readers that this universal
genius, zfocccfion had called fhrth his talents in that way, would have madent!
incorfiderable figure as a controverfial writer.

SHOULD be glad to know, my good friend, why you call me Pro-'

metheus. If by this you mean that my works are ditty, Ι acknowlcge
the fimilitude, and have no objedfion to the title of a modeller in clay,
even though my stuffssiould be the worst 1 could piel< up, the very mud of
the highway; but if you really compared them for their excellency with the
performances of that most learned Titan, Ι shall look upon your praise as
ironical‚ and nothing but an Attic sneer: for what, indeed, haveI to boast of
that is so mighty ingenious ? What great wisdom or knowlege is there in my
writings? It is sufficient for me if you esteem them as not quite earthy and
sordid, nor as such condemn them to Caucasus. With how much more
justice might Ι compare you to Prometheus, you famous gentlemen of the
law, who wage eternal war with truth; how full of life and spirit are your
works! so animated that they seem all on fire ε performances truly Prome-
thean, save that your images are made of gold instead of clay. We, who
work for the vulgar, only make plaister statues for a public speetacle,
and puppets of clay, as other potters do; but they have no motion like
yours, no representation of life, a mere spott, and childish diverfion : some-
times it occurs to me that you call me Prometheus, as the ἦέ comic poet
did Cleon, “ a † perse& Prometheus (says he) is Cleon, after the

the passage alluded to is not to be found in any of that author's comedies now extant.

as Prometheus, and who shewed great abilities, like him, when there was no occafion to exert

them.
