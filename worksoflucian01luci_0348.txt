see the little animal peeping out of the philosopher’s cloak, just under his
heard, and every now and then besprinkling him (which by the by he did
not mention to me himself), then yelping with a little sharp voice, as those
dogs of Melita generally do, and licking his chin, allured‚ perhaps, by the
smell of yesterday’s broth upon it: upon which the minion, who is some·
times happy in his jokes upon the company, when he came to Thesmopolis
