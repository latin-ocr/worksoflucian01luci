ourselves there is no danger, our enemies being all su-bdued) by applying
these rules if they like them, they may know better how to write for the fu-
ture : if they do not chuse this, they may even go on by their old measure,
the ᾖ· phyfician will not break his beart if all the people of Abdera follow
their own inclination, and continue to a& the Andromeda.

Criticism is twosolcl3 that which teaches us what we are to chuse, and
that which teaches us what to avoid : we will begin with the last, and confidet
what those faults are, which a writer of history should be free from3 next,
what it is that will lead him into the right path, how he should begin, what
order and method he should ohserve, what he should pass over in silence,
and what he should dwell upon, how things may be best illustrated and con-
neC'ted. Of these, and such as these, we will speak hereafter3 in the mean
time, let us point out the faults which bad writers are most generally guilty
of, ,the blunders which they commit in language, compofition, and senti-
ment, with many other marks of ignorance, which it would be tedious to
enumerate, and belong not to our present argument3 the principal faults, as
I observed to you, are in the language and composition. i

Yon will find on examination, that history in general has a great many of
this kind, which, if you listen to them all, you will be sufficiently convinced
0s3 and, for this purpose, it may not be unseasonable to recolleffil: some of
them by way of example: and the first that l shall mention, is that intoler-
able custom' which most of them have of omitting faets, and dwelling for-
cver on the praises os their generals and commanders, extolling to the sszies
their own leaders, and degrading beyond measure those of their enemies, not
ltnowing how much history differs from panegyric3 that there is a great wall
between them3 or, that to use a musical phrase, they are a double † οξῒεὶνε
distant from each other: thc sole business of the panegyrist, is, at all
events, and hy every means to extol, and delight the objeci: of his praise,
and it little concerns him whether it be true or not, But history will not
admit the least degree os falsehood‚ any more than, as phyficians say, the
‡ wind-pipo czin receive into it any kind of sood.

any part of our sood ssips down what is generally called the wrong way.
