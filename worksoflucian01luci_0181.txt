ι DIOGENES.

MAUSOLUS, why all these haughty airs, as if you thought yourself
superior to every body else ?

MAUSOLUS.

claffical taste and extensive learning, as for his extraordinary skill in his profeffion‚ has recorded
this singular transaffion in some excellent Latin lines, which, as, l believe, they were never yet
printed, I shall here subjoin (forgive me this liberty, my good friend, Dr. Baiter& for the cn-
