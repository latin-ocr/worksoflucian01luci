45 TIMON.

this is Timon's law, and this hath Timon ratified; thus it is determined‚
and this I will abide by. I⁴ should be glad, however, that all might know
how Ι abound in siches, because that, Iknow, will make them miserable.
But hush! whence 311 this noise and hurty? What crowds are here, all
covered with dust, and out of breath; some how or other they have smelt
out the gold. Shall 1 get upon this hill, and pelt them from it with stones,
or 111311 Ι, for once, break my resolution, and have some conference with
them? It will make them more unhappy, when they find how I despise
them3 this will be the best method3 I will stay, therefore, and receive
them. Ha! who is that, the first of them? O, it is ‘³⁴⁶ Gnathonides, who,
but the other day, when Iasszed him for a supper, held out a rope;

though he had emptied many a cassz with me. 1 am glad he is come, for
hc shall first feel my resentment.

GNATHONIDES.
Said I not, the gods would not long forget so good 3 man as Timon?
⁷ hail, Timon! hail, thou fairest, sweetest, most convivial of men!

T Ι M O N.
1-1311 to thee, Gnathonides, thou most rapacious of all vulturs, thou most
detestable of all human beings !

GNATHONIDES.
Thou wert always a lover of raillery and sarcasm 3 but where is the feast?

for Ι have brought you 3 new song out of the † DithyrambiCS, which I lately

learned.
T I M O N.

1111311 teach you soon, by the help of this spade, to fing some mournful

elegies, Ibelieve. [Beats him.
GNATHONIDES.

NVhat now! Timon, do you strike me? Bear witness, Hercules! O me!
O me! but Ι will call you into the Areopagus for this.

³⁸ Gnatl.›0nides‚] It is observable‚ that Terence, in the Eunuch, calls his parasite Gnatho,

and, as if it were a new name, makes him say, after the conversation between him and the 1ηο
ferior flatterer⁹

I bade him follow me,

And, as the schools of the philosophcra

Have ta'en from the philosophers their names,

So, in like manner, let all parafites

Be call‘d from me, Gnathonice. Colman⁹s Terence, p, ¹30.

ἦν Dithyrambics‚] Hymns in honour of Bacchus, who was called Dithyrambus‚ fora reason
too ridiculous to deserve an explanation to the English reader.
