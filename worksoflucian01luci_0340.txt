petually prating, and some of them, perhaps, laying up a stock of still
severer calumny against you. ι .

The whole feast, therefore, may be called your's, as all the conversation
is about you ; and now, drinking more than you are used t0, of light thin
wine, you are very ill with it: to get up before the rest of the company
would be rude, and yet to stay longer is hardly safe. The drinking
goes on, one story succeeds to, and one e'ntertainment comes on the back of
another: in the mean while you suffer no small uneafiness; neither able to
see any thing that goes forward, or to hear the young men fing and play;
commend, however, you must, though you are wishing all the time that an
earthquake would shake the room, or an alarm of fire frighten the company,
and break. up the entertainment.

Such, my friend, is your first sweet supper. For my own part, Ishould
prefer an onion and salt, with the liberty to eat it when, and just as much
of it as I pleased : for, not to mention the disorders of the head and stomach
which generally follows a debauch of this kind, you are to meet the day after
to settle your salary‚ and the time of receiving it3 two or three friends are
called together, you are defired to sit down, and the great man begins : “ You
saw yesterday in what manner Ι live, that there is no form and parade in my
house, nothing ²²· grand or superb, but all plain and simple3 and I would
have you to understand that'you are to look upon every thing here as belong-
ing equally to us both : absurd, indeed, to the last degree would it be, when
Ι repose my whole mind, that greatest of all trusts, on you3 when 1 com-
mit to you the care of my children (if he has any), to refuse you any thing
else3 I know your moderation3 know that happy disposition of your’s, which
is alwaysits own best reward, and am satisfied, that you did not come to
live with me from any motives of sels-interest, but for the sake of my friend-
ship, and the regard which every body will have for you on that account:
since, however, a certain sum must be agreed on, let it be fixed: you shall
name it yourself, if you please; but remember, my friend, the presents
which yon niay expect from me on the annual festivals, which, however,
we determine this point, ssiall never be forgotten ; you will observe this, and

proportion your demand accordingly: but you scholarS, I knoW‚ are supe-
rior to all pecuniary confiderations.''
