D I O G E N E S.
Ι understand you now3 he gave you up to Pluto, instead of himself, and

so you died for him.
H E R C U L E S.

Something like that.
D 1 Ο G E N E S.

How happened it that AEacuS, who is a sharp looker out, did not know
you from him, but took in this iham Hercules ?

H E R C U L E S.
Because Iam so like him. ¹

D 1 O G E N E 8.
So like, indeed, that you are the very person z I wiffi you are not the true
Hercules yourself, and that it is your image which is wedded to Hebe in

heaven.
HERCULES.

You are a saucy prater3 and if you do not leave off sneering at me, you
{hall see presently whether Ι am an image of agod or not.

D I O G E N E S.

1 see your bow is ready stretched3 but what have I to sear from it, who
am dead already? But, by this same Hercules, I beseech you, tell me, whilst
he lived, were you with him as his image, or were you one and the same‘
during life, and separated after death, he flying off to heaven, and you hise
image, as became you, descending into hell ?

H E R C U L E S,
Such as seem resolved to.cavss and dispute, deserve no answer, however, 1
will give you one3 know then, all Amphitryon's part of Hercules, which
partl am, died, and all Jupiter’s is with the gods in heaven,

D I O- G E N E S.
Iapprehend you clearly: Alcmena brought forth two Hercules’s at the

same time, one by Amphitryon, and the other by Jupiter.

H E R C U L E S.-
No, f001; we were both one and the same.

D 1 0 G E N E S.
Itis past my comprehension how you can make two Hercules's, unless,
like the Centaur, the man and god werejoined together.
H E R C U L E S.

² ¹ Are not we all compounded of two parts, the soul and the body, why
then·
