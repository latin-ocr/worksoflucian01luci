'5 THEDREAM.·

The other, then, fixing her eyes on me, said, “ You have determined aright,
and 1 will recompense you for it; approach, therefore, and ascend this charior,
(pointing to one drawn by winged horses, like Pegasus), and see what you
would have lost if you had not followed me.'' As soon as Igot up, ss1e took
the reins and drove. I was lifted up on high, and carried from ea'st to west,
beholding‚ as Ipaffed along, various nations, kingdomS, and people‚ like
³* Triptolemus, scattering his seed over the earth. † What it was I dropped
upon them myself I cannot remember3 l only know, that wherever 1 went,
nien looked up to and addrefl'ed uie like a deity with praycrs and praises.
KYhen she had {hewcd me these things she brought me back, not clothed
as when Ι set out, but in an elegant and splendid garb, which she took care
to ssiew to my father, who stood waiting sor my return, not without hinting
to him how mean and unworthy a profeffion he and his friends had con-
demned me to. Such, Ι remember, was the dream which I had when a boy,
terrified as Ι was by the blows Ι had just received. But whilst I am relating
it, methinks I hear some one crying out, O Hercules, what a tedious ju-

⁴¹ Like Triptolemus‚] Triptolemus, kingof Eleusis, is said to have first brought into Greece
the worship of Ceres, who, in return for his civilities, equipped him with a fine chariot drawn
by two dragous, in which he drove round the world, and as he flew along scattered seeds upon
the earth. The invention of the plough is likewise ascribed to him. The foundation of this
flory is probably no more than that Triptolemus was one of the first who praCiii'ed husbandry,
and perhaps wrote some books concerning it, which were transported into foreign countries in a
fhip called the Dragon.

† What it ext-as, &c.] Though Lucian modestly pretends not to know, his readers, however,
can tell what it was he dropped on this occafion, viz. a large quantity os good sense, wit, and
humour, which are scattered throughout his works.

1 Herculcs’s, fissa] Jupiter is said to have spent three nights with Alcmena when he begat Her-
cules. These three nights Lucian humouroussy calls Hercules’s dream. q

of his Anabafis, or Retreat of the Ten Thousand.
