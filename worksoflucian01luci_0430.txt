history, iS, to be useful: a species of merit, which can only arise from its
truth ; if the agreeable follows, so much the better; as there may be beauty
{n a wrestler ε and yet Hercules would esteem the brave though ugly Nico-
stratus as much as the beautiful AlcaeuS. And thus, History, when she
adds pleasure to utility, may attract more admirer53 though, as long as she
is possessed of that greatest of pei-sections, truth, she need not be anxious
concerning beauty.

In history, nothing fabulous can be agreeable ; and flattery is disgusting

to all readers, except the very dregs of rthe people: good judges look with
the eyes of Argos on every part, reject every thing that is false and adulter-

ated, and will admit nothing but what is true, clear, and well expreffed3
these are the men you are to have a regard to when you write, rather than the
vulgar, though your flattery should delight them ever so much. If you stuff
hillory with fulsome encomiums, and idle tales, you will make her like Her-
cules in Lydia ; as you may have seen him painted, waiting upon Omphale,
who is drefl'ed in the lion's sszin, with his club in her hand·, whilst he is re-
presented, cloathed in yellow and purple, and spinning, and Omphale beat-
ing him with her ssipper ε a ridiculous spectacle, wherein every thing manly
and godlike is sunk and degraded to effeminacy.

The multitude perhaps, indeed, may admire such things; but the judicis..
ous few, whose opinion you despise, will always laugh at what is absurd, in-
congruous, and inconsistent : every thing has a beauty peculiar to itself: but
if you put one instead of another, the most beautiful becomes ugly, because
it is not in its proper place. I need not add, that praise is agreeable onlv t0
the person praised, and disgustful to every body else, especially when itis
lavishly bestowed; as is the practice of most writerS, who are so extremely
defirous of recommending themselves by fiattery, and dwell so much upon it,
as to convince the reader it is mere adulation 3 which they have not art enough
to conceal, but heap up together, naked, uncovered‚ and totally incredible:
so that they seldom gain what they expected from it; for the person flatter-
ed, if he has any thing noble or manly in him, only abhors and despises
them for it as mean parafiteS. Aristobulus, after he had written an account
of the single combat between Alexander and Porus, showed thar. monarch a
particular part of it, wherein, the better to get into his good* graces, he had
inserted a great deal more than was true: when Alexander seized the book

and threw it (sor they happened at that time to be sailing on the Hydaspes,)
