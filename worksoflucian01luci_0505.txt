trary. All in short, will be different, according to the differente of place.
And thus it is with distempers, according to the bodies they are lodged in,
they thrive 3ηά increase, or diminish and go away. But all this, my father,
having never inquired into it, paffes over, and exper that madness in every
body should be the same ; and consequently, that the same methods must be
made use of in the cure of it. “

Itis easy, moreover, to prove, that the bodies of women arc very differ-
ent from those of men, both with regard to the distemper itsclf, and to the
ease or difficulty of removing it. The bodies of males are robust, ἧος-ΑΥ,
inured to labour, and exercised in all weathers: those of fernales soft and
iax, used to {hade and retirement, pale from the want of blood, deficient in
natural heat, and abounding in humours, more obnoxious to diseascs than
men, and remarkably subject to insanity; for, as women have much levity,
and warmth of disposition, and are, moreover, more inclined to anger and
resentment, with bodies weak and infirm, they frequently sall into this dis-
order. It would be unreasonable, therefore, to expe& from physicians, the
fame method of cure which they practise with men, when they are convinced
how different they are in all their employrnents‚ and studies, and their
whole way of life, in which they are separated from υς, even at the earliest
period of it. When you say, therefore, ihe is mad, you should add also,
that a woman is mad, and not coufound two different things under orte name,
but separate them, as nature hath, and confidet what is proper to bc done in
both. First, therefore, as lobserved in the beginning of my discourse, ue
must inquire into the nature and temperament of the body, uhcther it be
cold or hot, of ripe age or advancing into years, large or small, fat or lean,
and so forth ι whoever enquires carefully into these things may be trusted,
and will then be able to say, whether the case be desperate, or there arc any
hcpes of success.

Of madncss itself, there are various kinds, from various causes, and with
different appellations; nor is it the same thing to be foolifh, to rave, to be
furious, to be melancholy3 these are all different names of the disease in its
different states: the causes, likewise, are different in men froin what they
are in women, in old men and in young; in the latter, sor instance, the dis·

order proceeds from a great quantity of bile and acrid humours, in the lat·
ter from an overflow of intemperate anger, and unreafonablc resentment,
