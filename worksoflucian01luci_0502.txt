laws 3 and that neither could it ever be just and right, to expel and drive
from his father and family, one who had deserved so much better of them.

And now let us proceed to examine what the crime is which I stand accus·
ed of: and here we must again recur to the intention of the legissature. Sup-
pofing therefore, for a while, that you have a right to banish as often as
you please, even one who has conferred benefits on you; yet you have not a
right to do this for any cause you shall think proper to aflign. The legissa-
tor doth not say, whenever a father accuseS, let the son be banished3 it suf-
ficeth that he wills it, and that he can prove the faet alleged : where then
would be the neceffity of a trial? But, on the other hand, he commands
you, judges‚ to try and determine whether the father is justly incensed or
not; this must be the subjec‘t of our inquiry.

I shall begin, therefore, with what happened immediately after the mad·
ness. The first thing which my father did when he came ῖό himself, was to
rescind the sentence against me3 then I was his benefacior, his preserver,
every thing in short, to him: in this certainly there could be no crime.
With regard to what followed, what does he accuse me of? what duty,
what action required of a son, did I omit? when did 1 stay out all night? what
unseasonable revels or debauches was I ever guilty of? what pimp didl
ever abuse or quarrel with? who hath ever appeared against me? not one.
These are the things which the laws allow, as fit and sufficient causes of
banishment.

'But my mother-in·law was taken ill 3 and what of that ? VVas 1 therefore
to blame, was Ianswerable for her disorder? n0, you say3 what then ? why,
because, you say, you were commanded to cure her and would not; you re·
fused to obey your father, and therefore you ought to be difinherited. I
shall not at present dwell on the reasons why Ι didi not comply with com·
mands which it was not in my power to cbey; but, first, beg leave simpl-y
to observe, that neither doth the law permit him to enjoin every thing, nor
deeius it necessary that 1 should obey in every thing. There are some com·
mantis which 1 am not obliged to comply with ; and others, which, if not
complied with, subjec't the offender to punishment. These, doubtless, may
be reasonable causes of resentrnent3 but there are others in our own power to
comply with or not, such, for instance, as depend on the asts, and our em-
ployment of them. If the son be a painter, and the father sayS, son, paint
