346 HERMOTIMUS.

swer)‚ did you never hear of Stoics and Epicureans differing about the be·
ginnings and ends of all things ?

HERMOTIMUS.
Never.

Mark‚ now, how you endeavour to missead your friend. I am in search
of true philosophy, you carry me to the Stoics, and tell me, they, and they
alone, have discovered that two and two make four3 but this is a doubtful
point3 for the Platonics and Epicureans may say that they have found this
out, and that you make five or seven of it: this you do when you affirm,
that nothing but what is honest can be good; whilst the Epicureans tell us,
nothing can be good that is not pleasant : you say, every thing in nature is
corporeal, but Plato says there are many things incorporeal : you, therefore,
argue unfairly, Hermotimus, by referring every thing to the Stoics, when
the judgment of others ought to be consulted also, and every one heard in
theIr turnS, before we determine.

Lycium, you do not seem rightly ro understand what Ι mean.

L Y C Ι N U S.
Make it plainer then, if you have any thing more to urge.

H E R M O T 1 M U S.
1 will immediately. Suppose‚ then, that two men carne into the temple
of Bacchus, or AEsculapius ; a cup is miffing from the altar, both of them
must be searched, to see which ofthem has got it in his bosom.

L Y C 1 N U S.
Certainly.

¹ H E R M o T 1 M U s,
For one of them must have it.

L Y C 1 N U S.
Most probably.

HERMOTIMUS.

But if you find it upon one, you need not strip the other, as it is plain

he cannot have it.

L Y C 1 N U S.
Plain enough.

H E R M O T I M U S.
And if you do NOT find it in the bosom of the first, the other must have
it, and there is no occafion to search him for it.

LYCINUS.
True.
