THE

SCYTHIAN.

This seems to have been an oration, or, perhaps, only Part of one, spoken by Lu-
CIAN, befhrefhme popular Affimbly at Athens, probably befhre he had dssinguffhed
himself as a Witer. As a Foreigner, he endeavours to recomnzend himself to the
Ashenians, and to conciliate the public Favour. The Comparzssm, which he draws
between Anacharfis ancl himself, though it fizvozers rather too much of authorial
Vanity, is ingenious, and his artful Addreſs to two leading Μή, towards the End
of the Discomse, shews a Knowlege of Mankind, which, we mqy suppcffe, was of
no little Service to him.

NACHARSIS was not thefirst who came out of Scythia to learn the

arts of Greece3 for before him Toxaris, a man of great wisdom and
knowlege, and one who had a taste for truth and beauty‚ travelled thither:
he was not of royal or noble race, but a plebeian of that country, one of
those whom they call ”ff OCtipedes, which fignifies master of two oxen, and
one waggon3 he never returned to Scythia, but died at Athens; soon after
which he was ranked amongst the heroes ; and the Athenians‚ to this day,
offer up an annual sacrifice to him, under the title of the foreign phyfician:
how he came by this appellation, and why he was thus honoured as a son of
AEsculapiuS, it may not be amiss to inform you, that you may learn it is not
the Scythians alone who bestow immortality, and send meffengers to † Za·

tholxis, but that the Athenians also deify'their Scythian heroes.
During the time of the great 13 plague, the wife of Architeles, the Areo-

farmers to be sure.

ἦ· Zamolxis.] The great deity of the Scythians3 who believed that if they lived a good life,
they should meet him in the regions of the bleffed. Every five years this barbarous people sent “
what they called a meffenger to him; the manner of which was no less singular than cruel ι
when they had fixed on the person to be immorralized, they drew out three pikes, οι· javelius,
and threw the man up into the air, if he had the good fortune to fall upon one ofthe javelius,
and be killed by it, they looked upon it as a propitious omen, anti that Zamolxis accepted the
vistim, and would favour them in every undertaking3 if he did not die with the wounds, thev
confidered him as a rascal, and tried the experiment on some other person. This story is told

b Herodotus.
yg Plague.] In the time of the Pelopormefian war. As related by Thucydides.
