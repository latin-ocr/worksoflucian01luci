Some T ime after the Appearance of the preceding Tra& on Dependants, and when
Lucum, as he has hfWser biformed us, eoasfar advnnced in Tems, he had the
good Fortnne to he preferred, by the Emperor M. Aurelius, to a Place of great

’ Hononr and Prcfit, which seems, by his own Acconnt of it, to have been little leſs
than the Governnzent of some extefffive Province. His Enemies (forsuch, Μή of
superior W't and Genius will always have), djd not fail, we may suppose, ῃ) re-

that Freedom and Independence, sb way-mly recomnzended by him in evevy Part of
his Wrztings, and particularly in tle abo-ve mentioned Τναὲῗ, which this APOLOGY
is written ‚in Deftnce of. In this Letter before us, LUcIAN nrtfnlly puts the
Objeffz‘ions of his Enernies into the Mouth of his Friend, every one of which he

distance of time, Ι imagine, you will say about it. If I have any skill in
prophecy, I think you will speak thus: “ can there, say you, be a man, who
after writing such things», after so pompous a declamation against this kind
oflife, could thus suddenly forget all he had said, and having thus, as

Ἃ With regard to this circumstance (forgive the vanity‚ kind render), there seems to be
some similitude between Lu CIAN and his TRANSLATOR ; it was the fate of them both, after

a life oflabour and disappointment, to be honoured in the decline of it, by the notice and

patronage of their Sovereign. W bether the resemblance between us holds in any other parti-
cular, must be left to the determination of the reader.
