THEDISINHERITEDSON. 465

Will you then suffer him who has gone through all this, who has struggle&
⁷ thus with the most obstinate of disorderS, who has conquered the most uncon-
querable of them, to be thus treated; will you permit the restored patient to
interpret the laws at his own will and pleasure, and to fight against nature?
Ι, Ojudges, obeyed her dietatem and preserved my father, even though he
had injured me. But if he, in obedience to the laws, as he calls it, destroys
the son who saved him, and deprives him of his birth-right; he surely may
be called the children-hater, I the father-lover z I embrace nature, he despises
her, and tramples on her commands. Unhappy father, so unjusty to hate;
more unhappy son, so undeservedly to love ! thus persecuted, Ι accuse myself
fot loving him more than duty bids me, and more than I ought3 for nature
commands'parents to love their children, more than it requires children to
love their parents: but he contemns the laws which always preserves the
birth-right for those sons who are innocent, and nature also, which plants
strong affeffion in parents towards their children. But, as he has yet stronger
reasons to be kindly affeelionate to me from the services I have done him,
he ought certainly to be still more fond of me, at least to imitate my con-
dud‘c, and emulate my attachment to him : but alas l instead of this, he cen-
sures him who hath so loved, injures him who hath so obliged, banisheth
him who harh embraced him; and hath so distorted the laws, as to make
those which are favourable to children, to the last degree prejudicial to them.
How, alas ! my father, dost thou contend both with the laws, and with na-
ture3 alas! it is not, my father, as you would have it to be; you misinter-
pret the best constituted laws, which always co-operate with nature, in sup-
port of benevolence3 they never contradi& but follow each other, and unite
to repel every injury. You treat reproachfully one who hath deserved well
of you, and therefore are injurious to nature. Why abuse the laws also?
good and just as they are towards us, you will not permit them to be so,
but stir them up against one son, as against many, to infli& punishment on
those who never deserved it. The laws condemn him, for ingratitude, who

doth not return thanks for benefits received. But what can exceed the in-
jury committed by him, who not only doth not return the benefit, but punish·
eth his benefa&or for it! If these things are so, Ithink I have sufficiently
demonstrated‚ that he hath no right to banish and difinherit a second time,
who bath already exercised the paternal authority, and appealed to the

VoL.. Ι. O o o laws :
