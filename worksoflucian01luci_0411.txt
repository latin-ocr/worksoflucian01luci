ΗΑΚΜΟΝΙΒΕΒ.Δ 37,-

The advice of Timotheus, in this speech, in my opinion, not only suits
Harmonides, but may be applied to all those who pant for glory, and po-
pular applause; as I had the same ambition, therefore, I was resolved to
follow it, and for that purpose considered with myself who was the greatest
man in this city, whose judgement others would rely on, and on whom alone
1 might safely depend, when you occurred to me as the proper person3 one
in whom all virtues are united, the rule, as it were, and standard of per-
fection. Is you had seen my works, and praised them (and much Ι wish
you had), I should have gained the defired end of all my labours, and, by
your favour alone, acquired the approbation of all. To have preferred any
other suffrage to your's, would have been unpardonable folly: to one alone
I would trust my cause, which would be the same as if 1 had shewn myself
to all mankind3 for you are of more consequence than all: the kings of
Sparta had two voices, and every body else but one3 but you unite in your-
self the power of the ephori, and of the senate also. In learning, indeed,
you ought always to prefide and ducet, because you are always candid and
judieious, and therefore it is, that, alarmed as l am at the d1fficulty of my
undertaking, I repose full confidence in you; and the rather, as 1 thinkyou
will be favourable to me, because Ι belong to the same city, which you
have yourself been so great an ornament to, both in your public and private
capacity: if the majority of votes should chance to be against me, you, and
the few such as you, may yet prevail, make up the deficiency, and, as you
always do corre& every thing that is arniss, set all to rights again. It will
not satisfy my ambition that 1 have been formerly admired, that Ι am aln
ready celebrated, and that men praise my eloquen=ce3 Ι prize all this as
shadows, and mere nothing, in comparison with your applauk, which is the
great end of all: I would have uo doubts or uncertainty about my meris,
but be pronounced at once the best of all men z—but before 1 enter the
lists, in such a noble contest, shall I not hope for some propitious omen?
Confirm it, gracious gods, and give your sanetion to the praise Ι have receiv-
ed, that hereafter 1 may appear with confidence. He need not sear to stand

on any ground, who has conquered at Olympia.
