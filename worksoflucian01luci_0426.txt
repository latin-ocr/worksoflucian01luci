the * Andromeda of Euripides, and the speech of Persem, which they recited
in most lamentable accents: the city swarm'd with these pale seventh-day
patients, who, with lond voices, were perpetually'bawling out

O tyrant love, o'er gods and men supreme, ὅτε.

And this they continued every day sor a long time„ till winter and the cold
weather coming on, put an end to their delirium: for this disorder, they
seem, in my opinion, indebted to Archelaus, a tragediam at that time in
high estimation‚ whO, in thc middle of summer, at the very ’ἦ hottest season
of the year, exhibited the Andromeda, which had ⁴such an effect on the spec-
tators‚ that several of them, as soon as they rose up from it, fell insenfibly
into the tragedizing vein3 the Andromeda naturally occurring to their me·
mories, and Perseus, with his Medusa, still hovering round them.

Now if, as they say, one may compare great things with small: this Aba
derian disorder seems to have seized on many ofour Literati of the present age3
not that it sets them on affiting tragedies‚ (for the folly would not be so great
in repeating other people's verses, especially if they were good ones,) but ever
fince the war was began against the Barbarians, the defeat in ξς Armenia, and
the viftories consequent on it, not one is there amo-ngst us who does not write
a history, or rather, 1 may say, we are all Thucydides's, Herodotus’s, and
Xenophon's. Well may they say, ξ war is the parent of all things, when
one affition can make so many historians. This puts me in mind of what hap-
pened at Η Sinope: when the Corinthians heard that Philip was *going to attack
them, they were all alarmed, and fell to work, some bruffling up their armS,
others bringing ‚stones to prop up their walls, and defend their bulwarks,
every one, in short, ‚lendin-g a hand: Diogenes -observing this, and having

ἥ Andromcda.] A small fragment of >this tragedy, and which >has-in it the very line here
qamt-:d by Lucian, is yet extant in Barnes’s edition ofEu-ripides.

† Hottest seusam] This story may afford no useless admonition to the managersof the Hay-
market‚ and other summer theatres, who, it is to be hoped, will not run the hazard of inflam-
ing their audiences with too much tragedy in the dog-days.

ζ Armenia] This alludes to the Parthian war, in the time of Severian ; the particulars of
which, except -the few herc occafionally glanced at, we are strangers to. Lucian‚ most pro·
bably by this stadt, totally knocked up some of the historians who had given an account of it,

and prevented many others who were intimidated by the severity of his strietures, attempting
to transmit the history ofit to posterity.

ξ War is, δα] This saying is attributed to Empedocles.

u Sinope.] The most famous of the *Pontic citieS, and well known as the refidence of the re·

¹nowned Cynic philosopher. It is still called by the same name, and is a port-town of Afiatic
Turkey, on the Euxine.
