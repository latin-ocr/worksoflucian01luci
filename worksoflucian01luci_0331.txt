ONDEPENDANTS. 295

unattentive did 1 listen to those wh0, saved as it were from ssiipwreck, re-
lated their adventures, like those happy few whom we behold in the temples,
with *ff ssiaved crowns, talking over their perils by waves and stormS, pro-
montories, throwings overboard, broken masts and rudders, telling‚ withal,
how † Castor and Pollux appeared propitious to thern (for these are neces·
sary attendants on tragedies of this kind), or some other god descending
from his car, as they do on the ‡ stage, perched on the top-mast, or stood
at the belm, and guided the veffel to some soft shore, where it was soon
freed from every danger, and the paffengers, saved by their protefting
deity, returned to their homes in peace3 where they tragedize rnost abun·

dantly, and relating all their sufferings, and how, with all their calamities,
they seemed to be peculiarly favour-ed and beloved by the gods, In like
manner did these rnen frequently entertain me with their domestic storrns and
tempests, their three-sold, five-sold, aye, and ten-sold waves. Shewing
how, when they first set off, the sea was placid ; and afterwards, what diffi-
culties they went through in the voyage, from the salt water, thirst, and
fickness ; how they bulged on rocks, staved their veffel, and swam naked to
ssxore, andin want of every necessary. Ι observed, rnoreover, that all this
time they seemed purposely to conceal many circumstances, which they were
assiarned to relate, and wished to bury in oblivion. But these, and a great
deal more, which Ihave collected on this subject, I shall make no scruple

of imparting to you, my good TimocleS, as 1 understand you have for some

ἃ Shaved crowns.] Those who were so fortunate aa to escape from a ffiipwreck always cut off
their hair as an offering to the deities of the sea, who were supposed to have preserved them,
probably, because they thought a few hairs no improper returns for saving the whole head, or,
perhaps, for the reason affigned in the following epigram, which we meet with in the Antho—

Which may be thus transsated, leaving out the names,
To those kind gods, who deign’d his life to spate,
Lucilius offers up his votive hair;
He hopes this little boon they will receive,
For, in good truth, 'tis all he has to give.

† Castor and Pollux.] Supposed to be the tutelary deities of mariners, who always addreffed
their prayers to thern in times of danger and distress.

ζ On thcstage.] According to the practice of the ancient dramatists, of calling in sorne deity
at the end of the play to unty the knot‚ and bring on the catastrophe, alluded to by Horace,

Nec deus interfit nifi dignus vindice nodus.
