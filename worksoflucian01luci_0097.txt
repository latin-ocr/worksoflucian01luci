CAUCASUS. 6,

therefore, I wished itto be, but rational, intelligent, and endowed with a
sense of good and evil ς Ι began then, as the ’Χ poet sayS,

To temper well the clay with water, then
To add the vigour and the voice of men.

Moreover, Ι called in Minerva to affist me in the work. This, after all, is
the great injury which I have done to the gods3 by making creatur-es out of
clay, and giving motion to that which was before immoveable3 and yet
from that time it seems the gods are less gods, because certain creatures
called mortals now exist : for Jupiter is very angry, as if the gods were so much
the worse from the creation of men3 he is afraid, perhaps, that they should
rebel against him, and wage war with the gods, as the giants did of old :
but neither from me, or from my works, Mercury, most incontestible
it is, hath any harm arisen. Shew me the least inconvenience‚ and Ι
will fairly confess that you have but done justice in thus punishing
me.

But I can farther prove, that all this is for the benefit and advantage of
the gods ε which you will acknowlege, when you come to confidet that the
earth is no longer void of form and beauty, but adorned with plants and
cultivated fields‚ the sea navigated, the issands inhabited, altars, temples‚
sacrifices, and temples on every fide, the public ways all full of men, and
† full of Jove. If indeed I had created men for myself alone, I might seem
to have consulted my own private benefit; butI have brought it all into the
whole community3 and yet Jupiter, Apollo, and you, Mercury, have tem-
ples; but there are none to Prometheus; you see then how watchful 1 am
of my own interests‚ and how careless of yours.

But attend to this, 1 beseech yon, above all; can that be called a ‡ good,
which has no witness‘es to its goodness3 is that pofl'effion, which none can
see or praise equal to that which all value and esteem ? Without men the
beauty of the universe could have no admirers. We should but abound in
riches, which were neither envied by others, nor dear to ourselves. There
