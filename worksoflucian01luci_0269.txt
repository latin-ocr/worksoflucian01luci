·rfls SALE OF PHlLosoPHERs. 233

B 1 D D E R.
Away with thee ε thy tenets are filthy, and abhorrent to humanity.

D Ι Ο G E N E S.
But hark ye, friend, after all, mine is the eafiest way,

and you may go it
without any trou² le: it is a short cut to glory,

you will want no education,
learning, or trifles ‹,f that sort: be you ever so ignorant, a coblcr, a sausage-

monger, a blacl smsth, or a sutler, you will not be a whit the less admired,
provided you have but impudence enough, and a good knack at abuse.

B Ι D D E R.
Ι want you nor for such things : you may serve, however, by and by, for
a sailor, or a gardener, if he will sell you for two oboli.

MERCURY.

Aye, aye, take him 3 for he is so troublesorne, makes such a noise, and is
so abusive and insolent to every body, that we shall be glad to get rid of him.

JUPITER.

Corne, call up another: let us have that Cyrenian there, in purple, with

the garland on.
M E R C U R Y.

Now, gentlemen, draw near: this a valuable commodity, indeed, and
demands a rich purchaser. The sweet‚ the lovely, the thrice happy: which

of you longs for pleasure? Which of you buys my most ³¹* delicate of all

philosophers ?
B 1 D D E R.

Corne this way, you, and tell me what you know; I will buy you if you

aregood for any thing. M E R C U R Y

Do not disturb him, friend, nor ask him any questions3 for he is so
tipsy, and his tongue faulters so, he cannot answer you.

B I D D E R.
What man in his senses then would buy such a debauched good-for-no-
thing fellow! How he smells of ointment! staggers as he walks, and goes
all a-wry Ξ but tell me yourself, Mercury, what is he good for?

’ὓ Mqst delicate, δα] Aristippus (see Stanley), chief of the Cyrenaic sest of philosophers:
he leaned to the doctrine of Epicurus, and, from what we can gather concerning him, was ra-

ther of base principleS. pope, however, has put him into better company than Lucian‚ if now
alive, would probably think him fit for,

-—- Like Aristippus, or St. Paul,
-- Grow au to all.
