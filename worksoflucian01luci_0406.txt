370 HERMOTIMus.

plain countryman, who knew nothing of your fine philosophy, cried out,
Pray, wonderful Sir, complain not of any injury done you, because we
have not paid you for a few empty words3 what you sold us you have yet
in your own poffeffion, and are just as learned as you were before; but with
regard to what we sent him to you for, he is not at all improved3 for he
debauched my neighbour Echecrates's daughter, and would have suffered
for the rape, but that the father was poor, and l bought him off with a
talent of good gold : and not long since he beat his mother, who had caught
him hiding a calk of wine under his coat, which he was going to carry off
to his jovial club 3 add, to this, that, in impudence, lying, and quarrelling,
heis a much greater proficient than he was a twelve month ago, Ι had
much rather you would bave prevented all this, than have taught him to
informus every night at supper, how a ³¹⁶ crocodile seized a child, and pro-
mised to give him back again, when his father should answer some certain
question, about I know not what3 or to tell uS, that if it was day it could
not poffibly be night ε sometimes he introduces his horns, and perplexes us
all; meditates gravely on his habits, relations, ideas, conceptions, and such
stuff, which we laugh at : sometimes he will tell us that god is not in heaven,
but that ’116 paffes through, and is † inherent in wood‚ stone, animals, and
things the most trifling and contemptible. When his mother asks him how
he can throw away his time in such nonsense, he tells her, if he can but learn
these things he shall be rich, happy, and a king, and all mankind, besides,
nothing but his ‘ssaves and vaffals.

Thus spake the countryman3 and now mark what an old woman’s answer
the philosopher returned to him. Do not you think, said he, if the young
man had not been under my care, that he would have done something much
worse, something, perhaps, which he might have been hanged for? But
philosophy restrained him, moderated his paffionS, and heis, at least, to·
lcrable: he is ashamed of doing any thing misbecoming the great science I
have taught him; if, therefore, I do not deserve any reward for making
him better, you are at least indebted to me for what my philosophy has
prevented his being guilty of: as nurses send children to school, where, if
they learn nothing, they are at least out of harm's way: as to every thing

⁰ A croccdfla] This has been explained before.

† Inhercm, &cuj The system of the famous French philosopher, Malbranche, seems to be
founded on this idea. See an account of Malbranche, in Bayle’s Dic‘tionary.
