He expreffed his astonishment at what had befallen us, and then told us
hvis own story, which was as follows: ‘⁶ Strangers, said he, I am a Cyprian
by birth, and left my country to merchandise with this youth, who is my
son, and several servants. We sailed to Italy with goods of various kinds,
some of which you may, perhaps, have seen in the mouth of the whale:
we came as far as Sicily with a prosperous gale, when a violent tempest arose,
and we‘were toffed about in the ocean for three days, where we were swal-
lowed up, men, strip and all, by the whale, only we two remaining alive;
after burying our companions, we built a temple to Neptune, and here we
have lived ever fince, cultivating our little garden, raifing herbs, and eating
fifh, or fruit: the wood, as you see, is very large, and produces many
vines, frorn which we have excellent wine3 there is likewise a fountain,
which perhaps you have observed, of fresh and very cold water. We make
our bed of leaves, have fuel sufficient, and catch a great many birds, and
live‘fissi. Getting out upon the gills of the whale, there we wash ourselves
when we please. There is a salt lake, about twenty stadia round, which
produces fiih of all-kinds, and where we row about in a little boat, which
we built on purpose. It is now seven and twenty years fince we were swal-
lowed up. Every thing here, indeed, is very tolerable, except our neigh-
bours, who are disagreeable, troublesome, savage, and unsociable.” “ And
are there more (replied Ι), befides ourselves in the whale ?’' “ A great many,
said he, and those very unhospitable, and of a most horrible appearance:
towards the tail, on the western parts of the wood, live the ε TarichaneS, a
people with-eel’s eyes, and faces like crabs, bold, warlike, and that live up-
on raw flessi. On the other fide, at the right hand wall, are the r Tritono-
mendetes, in their upper parts men, and in the lower resembling weazeIS.
On the left are the ,ζ Carcinochires, and the lsThynnocephali‚ who have en-
tered into a league offenfive and defenfive with each other. The middle
part is occupied by the § Paguradae, and the u Pfittopodes, a warlike nation,

and remarkably swift-footed. The eastern parts, near the whale’s mouth,
being walhed by the sea, are most of thern uninhabited: Ihave some of
