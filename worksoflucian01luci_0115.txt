by my son’s importunity ε how could I ever have imagined such a missor-
tune would have happened?

JUPITER.

Did not you know how much care and caution are necessary in this3 and
that if you go but one step out of the way every thing must be ruined, did
not you know the violent spirit of the horses, and that the reins must be
held tight by main force ? if you give way in the least, they are gone, as he
experie‘nced, for away they pulled him, sometimes to the right, sometimes
to the left, sometimes diref'dy contrary to his proper course, upwards and
downwards, and, in short, wherever they pleased; he was utterly at a loss

how to manage them.

All that Ι knew, and therefore refused him a long time, and would not
trust him to drive3 but when he, and his mother Clymene, by tears and
prayers, had at last prevailed on me, I placed him myself in the charior, di-
re8oed him where to go, taught him how high he must mount up, and how
low he must descend, how to manage the reim, and keep the horses in pro-
perly. I told him how great the danger was if he did not go in the right
track: buthe, for he was but a child, surrounded with such fire, and lost
in such an immenfity of space beneath him, I suppose, was stupified: the
horses no sooner perceived that it was not I who drove them, than despifing
the youth, they turned out of the path, and did all this mischief: he,
letting go the reins, and afraid, l suppose, of being thrown off, held fast by
the nave of the wheel: buthe has suffered for his folly, and I have felt

enough on his account.
J U P 1 T E R.

You think so : but for such crimes, perhaps, you have not. This time,
however, I forgive you: but if you are guilty of the like again, and send
us such another deputy hereafter, you shall soon see whose flames are the
fiel-cest, your’s or mine. Let his fisters bury him at EridanuS, where he
fell from the charior, and weep amber over him. Then let them be con-

verted, through grief, into poplar trees. Do you mind your chariot (for
the pole is broke, and one of the wheels demolished), put the horses t0, and

drive ε but do not forget what has happened.
