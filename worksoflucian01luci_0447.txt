Observe how the great and sublime Homer aRs on these occafion53 as great a
poet as heis, he says nothing about Tantalus, Ixion, Tityus, and the rest
of them. But, if Parthenius, Euphorion, or Callimachus, had treated
—this subjefffc, what a nnmber of verses they would have spent in rolling Ixion's
wheel, and bringing the water up to the very lips of Tantalus! Mark also,
how quickly Thucydides, who is very ἦ sparing of his descriptions, breaks
off, when he gives an account of any military machine, explains the manner
of a fiege, even though it be ever so useful and neceffary, or describes cities,
or the port of Syracuse. Even in his narrative of the plague, which seems
so long, if you confider the multiplicity of events, you will find he makes
as much haste as poffible, and omits many circumstances, though he was ob-
liged to retain so many more.
When it is necessary to make any one speak‚ you must take care to let him
say nothing but what is suitable to the person, and to what he speaks about,
, and 'let every thing be clear and intelligible ε here, indeed, you may be per-
mitted to play the orator, and ffiew the power of eloquence. With regard
to praise, or dispraise, you cannot be too modest and circumspec‘c3 they
*should be strictly just and impartial, short and seasonable ε your evi«
dence, otherwise, will not be confidered as legal, and you will incur the
same cenfure as ἦ Theopompus did, who finds fault with every body from
enmity and ill-nature; ’and dwells so perpetually on this, that he seems ra-
ther to be an accuser, than an historian.
If any thing occurs that is very extraordinary orincredible, you may men·
tion without vouching for the truth of it, leaving every body to judge for
themselves concerning it z by taking no part yourself, you will remain

safe.

Remember, above all, and throughout your work, again and again, Ῑ
must repeat it, that you write not with a view to the present times only : that
the age you live in may applaud and esteem you, but with an eye fixed on
posterity; from future ages expe& your reward, that men may say of you,
‘⁶ that man was full of honest freedom, never flattering or servile, but in all

ἃ Sparing.] Here doctors differ. Several of Thucydides’s descriptions are certainly very long,
many of them, perhaps, rather tedious.
{- Theopompus] Lucian is rather severe on this writer. Cicero only says, De omnibus omnia

libere palam dixit3 he spoke freely of every body. Other writers, however, are of the same
opinion with our satirist with regard to him. See Dions. Plutarch. Cornelius· Nepos, &c-
