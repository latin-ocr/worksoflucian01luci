TneFISHERMAN. 275

Α PARRHESIADES.

There it goes: now, Neptune, be propitious. Oho! they are fighting
for the bair: some are gnawing the figs, others lay hold of the gold : very
well ε look, one of the strongest of them has got the hook in him : let me
see, what do you call yourself? but 1 arn a fool to expe& a fist1 will talk to

me; for they are all mute. Tell me, Elenchus, who is his master ?
E L E N C H U S.

Chryfippus. PARRHEsrADES.

True. Isee itis3 one might know that, indeed, by the Χ· name. Do
you, therefore, O Chrysippus, by Minerva, Ι intreat you, tell me, do
you know these men, or did you teach them to a& as they do ?

C H R Y S 1 P P U S.

You affront me, ParrhefiadeS, by that question; can you imagine Ι have

any thing to do with luch fellows as these?
PARRHESIADES.

Well said, Chrysippus, spoke like a man: so down he goes headlong
with the rest. It is a prickly rogue‚ and would break any man's teeth who

should attempt to eat him.
P H Ι L 0 S Ο Ρ Η Y.

We will bair: for no more, Parrhefiades, for fear one of them should run
away with the hook and gold together3 and then you must apply to the
ψ priestess again. Come, we will even take our walk: do you return to the
place from whence you carne, that you may not stay beyond your limited
time: you, Parrhefiades and Elenchus, must go about to them all, and

either crown or stigmatise them, as I commanded you.

P A R R H E S I A D E S.
It {hall be done : most noble friends, fare ye well. You and Ι, Elenchus‚
must go down and do as we are ordered. Which way shall we steer our

course first? to the Academy, or the Portico? we will begin at the Lyceum:
but it is no matter where; all 1 know is, whereverwe go, we shall want very

few crownS, but a number of hot irons to mark with.

ξ By the name] Another pun. Chrysippus, from χρυσος, chrysus, gold; alluding to the

bnit they were so easily caught with.
ἦ· <Tha priqstcss] The reader will recollecsk, that the gold they baited with was lent them by
the priestess, as well as the rod and line, which· Lucian tells us some fishermen had left as at».

offering in the Piraeum.
