then should not the soul which was from Jove, be in heaven, and l, the

mortal part, here below ?

D I O G E N E S.
True, my good son of Amphitryon, if you were a body; but you are on-

ly an incorporeal image. 1 arn afraid, therefore, at last, you will make out a

threefold Hercules.
H E R C U L E S.

How a threefold one ?

D I Ο G E N E S.
Why, thus; one, you know, is in heaven, you, the image, are here below,

and your body reduced to ashes on mount Oeta , there are three of you: now

find out a third father for your body.
v H E R C U L E S.
Thou art an impudent sophist; who are you?
D I O G E N E S.
1 arn the image of DiogeneS, the Sinopian. I do not converse, indeed,
with the irnmortal gods, but with the first quality amongst the dead, and
laugh at Homer and all such idle story-tellers.

DIALOGUE XXX.

MENIPPUS,ANDTIRESIAS.

M E N Ι P P U S.

TIRESIAS, whether you are blind or not we cannot eafily distinguissi ;
for here all our eyes are hollow, and only their sockets left, we cannot tell
which is ἦ* Phineus, and which is Lynceus; but the poets have informed us
that you were a prophet, and that you have been both rnan and woman ε by

the gods, therefore, Ibeseech you, tell me, in which sex did you lead the

happiest life ?
T 1 RE S Ι A S.

The woman’s life, Menippus, was much the most agreeable, and the
most easy ; the women always rule the men ι befides, that they need not go
to war, nor warch in the bulwarks, nor harangue in council, nor dispute in

the forum.

ἃ Phineus] Was a famous blind prophet, and Lynceus, οξυδερκεςητος, the most ssiarp fight-
ed of mortals. Pindar tells us, he saw Castor at a prodigious distance, though hid in the trunk

of ,a tree.
