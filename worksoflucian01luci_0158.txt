U N Ο.
Right, so we will: when we {ire got down, you, Venus, must go first,
and shew us the way; for you must certainly know it best, as, if fame say
true, you have often come down this way to Anchises.

V E N U S.
Your sneers give me no concern, 1 affure you.

MERCURY.

Come, Iwill lead you, for 1 am well acquainted with Ida, and often
visited it when Jupiter fell in love with the Phrygian boy; l used to be sent
