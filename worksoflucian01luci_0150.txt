DIALOGUE XXXVII.

NEPTUNE, Α TRITON, AND AMYMONE.

T R I T Ο N.
NEPTU NE, there comes every day to Lerna, for water, a most beautiful

virgin, I think I never saw a handsomer.

N E P T U N E.
A free wornan, think you, or a ssave used to draw water ?

Τ R I T O N.
O no: she is one of the fifty daughters of Danaus, and her name, for 1
enquired after her, is Amymone. Danaus brings up his daughters hardily,
makes them work, sends them to draw water, and do other things, that they

may never be idle.
N E P T U N E.

And comes she alone so long a way as from Argos to Lerna ?

Τ R 1 Τ Ο N.
Always by herself. Argos, you know, is very dry, and they are per.

petually wanting water for it.

N E P T U N Es
Triton, you affe& me strangely with the story of this girl ε let us go and

seeher.
T R 1 T O N.

With all my heart3 this is the time of her coming for water3 ssie is now

about half way to Lerna.
N E P T U N E.

Get the chariot ready then, or if it will take up too much tirne to put
the horses too, get me one of the swiftest dolphins to ride upon, that I may
be with her as soon as poffible.

T R 1 Τ 0 N.
Here is one of the nimblest for you.
N E P T U N Ε.
Away then, let us be gone; you, Triton, may swim thither. -And now
we are at Lerna, her‘e will I lay m wait for her, do you warch, and let me

know when you see her coming.
