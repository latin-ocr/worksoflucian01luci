296 OnDEPENDANTS„

time past had an inclination to enter into this course of life 2* for, frequently,
when the conversation turned upon it, and any of the company extolled the

happiness of those who lived with any noble Roman, when he observed what
elegant entertainments they partook of, without any expence, lived in
fine houses, travelled with ease and pleasure, lolled in chariots drawn by
white horses‚ and, with all this, were paid well for their company,
men who neither ³¹⁶ sow nor till, and yet enjoy every thing; how often, my
friend, haveI seen you gaping at these, and such like stories, with your
mouth wide open to swallow the bait ἱ That you may not, therefore, lay the
blame on me, or say, that when lsaw you bite at this fig-baited hook, I did
not endeavour to draw it back before you had swallovved it, but waited till
nothing bu't mere force could extra& it, and then stood still, and only cried
at your niisfortune, lest, Isay, you should bring this argument against rne,
which lcould not refute, and my silence should thus be injurious to you: I
will tell you every thing from first to last, that you may remember there is
but one way out of the net, and when -you have considered that the hook is
sharp, and bent witha-l, and donor find, if you try it on your cheek, that it
is intolerably piinful‚ and hard to draw out, then mark me down as 3 fool,
and as hungry after this bait as yourself, continue in your resolution, and,
if you will, gorg-e down the whole bait like a sea-wolf.

Though my discourse is defigned principally for your service, it will not
be confined to philosophers alone, or men of serious and grave profeffions;
but extend itself to grammarian& orators, muficianS, all those, in short,

who think it not beneath t‘hem to become hirelings and dependants, under
- the chamot& of teachers and companions. The same, indeed, is the treat-
ment of 311; but when philosophers meet with it, it is certainly more re-
proachful and ignominious, as their masters seldom use them better than
they do other men. In the course of my remarks it will appear, that those
who do the injury, and those who suffer it, are equally to blame. I shall,
, however, remain guiltless, unless truth and freedom are unpardonable. The
vulgar herd of sycophants and parasites, who have low and little minds, I
shall not attempt to diffuade from this way of life, nor would they, indeed,

the land of Cyclops,

Untaught to plant, to turn the glebe, or sow,
They all their products to free nature owe.
