wepleased, went a·hunting, pruned our vines, gathered our fruit, and lived,
i'n short, in every respect like men put together in a large prison, which there
was no escaping from, but where they enjoy every thing they can wish for
in ease and freedom3 such was our way of life for a year and eight months,
On the fifteenth day of the ninth month, about the second opening of the
whale’s mouth (for this he did once every bour, and by that we calculated
our time), we were surprised by a sudden noise, like the clash of oars 3 being
greatly -alarmed, we crept up into the whale's mouth, where standing be- -
tween his teeth, we beheld one of the most astonishing spectacles that was
ever seen 3 men of an immense fize, each of them not less than half a sta·
dium in length, sailing on issands like boats. Ι knowyvhat Ι am saying is
incredible, Issiall proceed, notwithstanding: these issands were long, but
not very high, and about a hundred stadia in circumference; there were
about eight and twenty of these men in each of them, besides the rowers on
the fides, who rowed with large cypreffizs, with their branches and leaves
on3 in the stern stood a pilot, raised on an eminence, and guiding a brazen
helm: on the fore-castle were forty immense creatureS‚ resembling men,
except in their hair, which was all a flame of fise, so that they had no oc-
casson for helmets, these were armed, and fought most furioussy3 the wind.
ruffiing in upon the wood, which was in every one of them, swelled it like
a fail, and drove them on, according to the pilot’s dstefflom and thus,
like so many long ships, the issands, by the assistance of the oars, also moved
with great velocity. At first we saw only two or three, but afterwards there
appeared above fix hundred of them, which immediately engaged, many
were knocked to pieces by running against each other, aud many sunk;
others were wedged in close together, and not able to get asunder, fought
desperately; those who were near the prows shewed the greatest alacrity,
boarding each other's ships, and making terrible havock3 none, however,
were taken prisoners. For grappling-irons, they made use of large ssiarks
chained together, who laid hold of the wood and kept the issand from mov-
ing: they threw oysters at one another, one of which would have filled a
waggon, and spunges of an acre long. AEolocentaurus was admira} of one·

of the fleetS, and ’ἃ Thalaffopotes of the other: they had quarrelled, it
seems, about some booty; ThalaffopoteS, as it was reported, having driven

’ὲ Thalaſjopotcs] Maris potor, the drinker up of the sea. AEolocentaurus and Thalaffopotes
were, I suppose, two Leviathans.
