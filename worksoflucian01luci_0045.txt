PRoMETHEth, 9

“ business is done.” The Athenians themselves used to call every earthen
veffel maker, every builder of ovens, and in short every dealer in clay, by
the name of Prometheus, in allusion to the stuff he worked with, and his
manner of baking it in the fire: if this be your meaning, you are a good
marksman; it is a true bitter Attic sarcasm: for my works are as brittle as
their earthen ware; throw but the least stone, and you dash them in picces.
But somebody, perhaps, to comfort me, will say, it is not in this* I arn
. so much like Prometheus, as because my work is new, and not made after
any model ; even as he, before the existence of men, formed some accord-
ing to his own invention, and created beings that moved about, and were
beauteous to look at: upon the whole he was an excellent archimen but
Minerva aflisted him, breathed into, and animated his clay. Thus, perhapS,
taking it in the most favourable sense, it might be interpreted, and such,
we will suppose, was the true meaning and intention of him who said it ς but
it will not satisfy me to have made something new, unless it was beautiful
also; for, be affured‚ if it was no't s0, I should be the first to despise
it. If it was ugly, the novelty would never save it from destru&ion : *and if
Ι did not think so, I should deserve to be preyed upon by sixteen ἥ vulturs,
for not knowing that what is good for nothing is but so much the worse for
being new. Ptolemy, the son of ἦ· Lagus, carried two novelties into
Egypt, aBaCtrian camel all black, and a man halfblack and half white; and
produced thern amongst other spectacles in the public theatre, where the
Egyptians were affembled, expediing, no doubt, that they would be great-
ly‘struck with the fight3 instead of which, when they saw the camel, they
were frighted out of their wits, and ran away as fast as they could, though
he was covered with a cloth of purple and gold, with a bridle of gems and
precious stones, as if he had belonged to a Darius, Cyrus, or Cambyses;
as to the black and white man, some laughed at it as ridiculouS, others ab·
horred it as a monster. then Ptolemy perceived there was no great honour
to be got by them, and that the Egyptians did not so much admire things
sor their novelty, as for their beauty and perfeffion, he forbad the shewing

’κ’ Vulturs,] Alluding to the vultur appointed by Jupiter to prey on the liver of Prome-
theus. See AEschylus, a& i. scene 1. The whole of this absurd story is severely ridiculed by
Lucian in his Caucasus.

-ξ- Son ofLagus,] To distinguissi him from Ptolemy Philadelphus· Both these great princes
were remarkable for their attention to natural philosophy.
