THEDREAM. 5

placed in the first seat, adorned with, and raised to rank and precedency.
If thou travellest, even in foreign countries thou shalt not live unknown or
inglorious; forI will render'thee so illustrions, that whosoever beholds
thee shall point thee out to his neighbour, and say, ᾗ “ that is he.” In
aught that is of moment or concern, either to thy friends or' country, the
eyes of all {hall be turned on thee; when thou speakest they shall listen with
eagerness and attention, admiring the power of thy eloquence, and envying
thy father's felicity in having such a son as thou art. Men, thou knowest,
have been raised 10 gods, and on thee will I confer immortality; for when
thou departest out of this life, thou {halt still converse only with the great
and good. Think on Demosthenes, whose son he waS, and to what emi-
nence 1 advanced him. Think on † AEschines, whose mother was a player
on the timbrel; by my affistance how was he courted by the great Philip ἰ

which eloquence shall bring, to put on a mean and sordid garb, to handle
tools, saWS, and hammers, and stoop to mean and abjest labour3 to think
on nothing manly, liberal, or great, but merely to see that your work is
finilhed, taking no care to keep your person neat and clean, but being ever
as dirty and contemptible as the stones you are carving?”

Scarce had she said this, when not permitting her to go on, 1 rose up, and
leaving the ugly mechaniC, flew with rapture to my fair patronesS,
Eloquence ε donbtless with the greaterjoy,from my remembrance of the blows
which 1 had received the day before. She whom Ῑ had deserted seemed
at first enraged at me, doubled her fists, and gnassied with her teeth, till at
length, like Niobe of old, she became fliff, and, wonderful to relate, was
turned into a block of marble. If this should seem incredible, Idefire
notwithstanding that you will believe it, for dreams are always miracu-louS.
