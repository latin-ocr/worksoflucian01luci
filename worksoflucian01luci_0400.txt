the κ nofe by every body, must follow, as the cattle do the bough that is

drawn any way by a finger3 or a reed by the river fide, bending to every blasi.
If, therefore, you can meet with a master, who himself knows, and can

we could not rely upon him, but must still search for another, to inform us
whether this man spoke truth or not: and when we had got him, it would

other proof3 for, how should we tell which was the best? you see, therefore,
how endlcss the labour is, and that there is nothing certain, or to be depend-
ed on. The demonstrations themselves may be called in question, and no
one point is absolutely certain. They would persuade us, that they know
