to the early hopes of Alcibiades: but what is past and done Clotho cannot
weave again, nor Atropos recall.

The only business of the historian is to relate things exaetly as they are:
this he can never do as long as he is afraid of Artaxerxes, whose ³²4 physician
he is; as long as he looks for the purple robe, the golden chain, or the
ἦ- Nisaean horse, as the reward of his labours; but Xenophon, that Just
writer, will not do this, nor Thucydides. The good historiam, though he
may have private enmity against any man, will esteern the public welfare
of more consequence to him, and will prefer truth to resentment; and, on
the other had, be he ever so fond of any man, will not spare him when he
is in the wrong3 for this, as 1 before observed, 'is the most effential thing in
history, to sacrifice to truth alone, and cast away all care for every thing else.
The *great universal rule and standard is, to have regard not to those who
read now, but to those who are to peruse our works hereafter.

To speak impartially, t'he historians of former times were too often guilty
of flattery, and their works were little better than games and sports‚ the
effefi'ts of art. Of Alexander, this memorable saying is recorded, “I should
be glad (said he), Onesicritus, after my death, to come to life again for a
little time, only to hear what the people then living will say of me: for I
am not surprised that they praise and caress me now, as every one hopes by
baiting well to catch my fa-vour.”< Though Homer wrote a great many fa-
bulous things concerning Achilles, the world was induced to believe him,
for this only reason, 'because they were written long after his death, and no
cause could be affigned why he should tell lies about him.

5 The good historian then must be thus described ε he must be fearless‚
uneorrupted, free, the friend of truth and of liberty, one who, to use the
words of the comic poet, calls a ᾗ fig a fig, and a skiff a skiff, neither giv-

history is stuffed with encomiums on his royal patron. 'See Plutarch⁰s Artaxerxes.

ἦ· Ngfaean hos-stu] The Campus Nisaeus, a large plain in Media, near the Caspian mountains,
was famous for breeding the finest horses, which were allotted to the use of kings only; or ac-
cording to Xenophon, those favourites on whom the sovereign thought proper to bestow them.
See the Cyropaed. book viii.

ss <The good hg'storz'an, &c.] This fine pifiure ofa good historian has been copied by Tully,
Strabo, Polybius, and other writers; it *is a standard of perfefflon, however, which few writers,
ancient or modern, have been able to reach. Thuanus has prefixed to his history these

lines ofLucian3 but whether he, or any other historian, hath answered in every point to the

description here given, is, I believe, yet undetermined.
,ξ Afig afig, &c.] The saying is attributed to Aristophanes, though 1 cannot find it there.
