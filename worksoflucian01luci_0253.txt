SACRIFICES.

In this little Tra& stveral Parts of the ancient Theogony‚ with many of the
absurd Stories propagated by the Pom, are severely ridiculed.

HEN we confidet how ridiculoussy men ael: with regard to their sacri-

fices, solemn feasts, and supplications to the gods 3 what they pray

fot· to, what they expect from, and what they think of 1116111, Ι know not
whether any of uS, be 116 ever so grave or melancholy, 6311 refrain from
laughing, who beholds the folly of it. But, before he laughs, might he
not ask himself, whether those thould be called good and pious, or rather, 011
the contrary, miserable wretches, and enemies to the gods, who 6311 sup-
pose the divine nature so mean and illiberal as to want the aid of man, to
rejoice in flattery, 31111 10 be angry when neglected. For all the calamities
of AEtolia, the misfortunes of the Calydonians, 311 1116 battles and ssaugh-
ter, with the destruction of ’Χ Meleager, all, it seems, was the work of
Diana, who was incensed at being forgotten in the sacrifice53 so heinoussy
did 1116 1616111 1116 affront. Isee her, methinkS, left all alone in heaven,
whilst the rest of the gods were gone to Oeneus, lamenting her fate, and ι
complaining what a noble feast 1116 11311 been disappointed of. Thrice happy,
on the other hand, must 'we esteem those AEthiopians, whom Jupiter so
kindly remembered3 because, as we read in the beginning of Homer’s poem,

³ l'lIeleager] The story is briefly thus τ Oeneus, king of Calydon, a city of AEtolia, made a
sacrifice to all the godS, in gratitude for a year of remarkable plenty in his kingdom ; but hap-
peniug‚ either by chance, or designedly, to forget Diana, 1116 resented the neglect, and sent a
furious wild honr, who ravaged the whole country. Meleager, the son of Oeneus, destroy-
edthe bom-3 bntaquarrel afterwards arose, stirred up, it seems, by the goddess, between the
Curetes and the AEtolians, about the head and skin of the beast: each party claiming them as
the reward oftheir valour: the AEtolians were worsted, and 011 1116 brink of destruction, but
were saved 31 last by the valour of Meleager. For a full account, see Ovid. Met. book viii.
Homer's Iliad, book ix. and the first book of Apollodorus.
