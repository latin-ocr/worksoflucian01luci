We want not your staff here, but your arguments 3 let us have no more
delay ε for the water is already poured out, and the court waits for you.

Are not you afraid they will give it against you?

Not at all : butI would wish to carry it by a great majority.

DIOGENES.

Who, and what we are, you, O Philosophy, well know3 words, there-
fore, are unneceffary on this occafion; for, to say nothing of myself, who
can be ignorant of how much benefit to mankind have been the works of
Pythagoras, Plato, Aristode, and the rest of us? Against characters thus
