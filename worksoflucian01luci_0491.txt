TnzTYRAN‘r-K1LLER. 453

so, of his fond attachment to his son3 1 well knew he could not long survive
him ι all parents have this affeetion for their children, and he above all, who
considered him as the best prop and support of his power, as going through
every danger for his father, and being, in short, his best security for the pos·
seffion of his empire. I knew, if not fromlove and tenderness‚ from sorrow
and despair he must soon perish, as well knowing that life could no longer be
precibus, when that power which his son alone could secure was taken from
him. Every thing, therefore, preffed upon him, nature, grief, terror, des-
pair, and the fear of that which was to come: these forces did I employ
against him, and drove him to his last determination: he died miserably‚
deprived of his son, weeping, and afflieted, lamenting, indeed, but a short
time, yet long enough to destroy a father, and, which was most dreadfuh
died by his own hand, the worst of all deaths, and infinitely more painful
than if he had fallen by any other.

Where is my sword? who layeth claim to it? who carried it up into the
tower? who laid it before t⁴hze tyrant? O thou, my friend and partner in the
noble deed, after all our dangers, how are we spurned and negle6³oed ! If for
- this sword, Ocitizens, lihould ask the reward; if I should say, the tyrant
left unarmed wished to die, and this my ‘sword supplied him with the means,
if this sword thus kindly affisted you in the restoration of your liberty, will·
you· not think 'tt worthy os honour and reward ? Would you not recompence
the master of so profitable an instrument, and inscribe his name in the list of
those who had best deserved of the commonweal ε would ye not hang up
this sword in your temple, would you not worship it amongst your deities?

And now listen to me, whilst 1 tell you what most * probably the tyrant
did, and what he said before his death: when he beheld the wounds on.
every part of his son's body (for 1 wished to shock him as much as poffible
with the sight) he would cry out with agonies on the unhappy parent, who
could only be a helpless spestator of h-is ruined family. For Ι, the principal
mstor in* this tragedy, had left behind the scene the sword, and all that was
necessary to fill up the mel-ancholy catastrophe, when, beholding his expir-
ing son, drenched in gore, with innumerable wounds‚ he cried out, ‘⁶ We
die, my son, we perish, we are ssain as tyrants: where is the murtherer?

ἃ· ant mooprobably] l't is plain from this fingle passage that the whole is nothing- but a
seigned tranfaffion, something only thar might have happened ε the orator tells you not what
the tyrant did say, but what he might have said, which confirms me 'm the opinion that this»
piece is merely a school-boy declamation.
