350 HERMOTIMUs,

Why, thus: there are two A’s‚ two B's, two C's, and two D’s, four let-

ters for the eight combatants3 the next letter E, therefore, must be the odd
one, and consequently belongs to him who is left fingle.

Shall 1 praise the art of your reply, or shall I say something in answer to it?

H E R M O T Ι Μ U S.
Answer it, by all means3 though I do not see what you can rationally pro-

duce agaInst it.

You contend that the letters are all put in alphabetically, first A, then B,
and so on, till there remains but one for the single combatant: and ar the
Olympics, I grant you, so it is : but suppose· we take five letters without any
order, as C S Z K T, inscribing four of them twice on eightlors, leaving
the letter Z for the last3 if, on examining, Z comes first to hand, how can
you tell that it belongs to the fingle combatant, unless you first gs· through

such as on two lors‚ for instance, two men, on two others two horses‚ two
cochs, or two dogs‚ and let the ninth be marked with a lion: now if you
should light on the lion first, how are you to know that to be the odd one,
except you first go through them all, to see if there is any other mark of a
lion corresponding with it.

To this, in good truth, Lycinus, l ihall give you no answer.

I suppose not, for it is unanswerable3 if, therefore, you see, we
want to find out the gold cup, or the best gulde to Corinth, or the
old lot, we must first try and examine all with the utmost prudence

and circumspection5 and, even then, with difficulty rhall we discover
