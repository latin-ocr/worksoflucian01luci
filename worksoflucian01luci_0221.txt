Did you never hear the Medea of EuripideS, where {he laments the mi-

series of her sex, and the intolerable pains of child-birth ? But, pray tell me
(for Medea's iambics put me in mind of it), did you ever lye-in when you

wereawoman?
T 1 R E S 1 A S.

Why do you ask that question?
M E N 1 P P U S.
Nay, no harm; it is eafily answered z what say you?

TIRESIAS.

And, pray, were you changed at once from a woman into a man ,³
T Ι R E S Ι Α S.
1 wonder what you mean by affiing me3 you seem as if you doubted
whether the fa& was really so or not.
M E N 1 Ρ Ρ U S.
Surely one may be allowed to doubt of such things a little ; or, do you think
we ssxould, like ideots, take them for granted?

T Ι R E S Ι Α 8. “
You do not believe other things, then, of the same kind, which you must

have heard, that women have been turned into birdS, beastS, and trees; as
Philomela, and Daphne, and the daughter of Lycaon?
M E N 1 P P U S.
When Ι light on them, Ι shall hear what they say themselves; but pray,
my friend, did you prophecy when you were a woman, and‘afterwards too?
· or did you commence man and prophet at the same time ?
T Ι R E S Ι Α S.
1 see you know nothing of my history3 how Ι made up a quarrel amongst ,
the gods ; how Juno deprived rne of my fight, and Jupiter made me amends,
by bestowing on me the art of prophecy.

M E N I P P U S.
And can you, TirefiaS, continue to propagate these falihoods? But it iz

the fashion with you prophetS, who never say any thing that is true.
