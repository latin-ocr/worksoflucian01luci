dirce-'ely into the river: ‘⁶ thus, said he, ought you to have been served
yourself, for pretending to describe my battles, and killing half a dozen ele-
phants for me with a single spear.'' This anger was worthy of Alexander, of
him who could not bear the adulation of that 4 ειτεὶιίῑεᾶ, who promised to
transform mount Athos into a statue of him ε but he looked upon the man,
from that time, as a base flatterer, and never employed him afterwards.
What is there in this custom, therefore, that can be agreeable, unless to
the proud and vain3 to deformed rnen, or ugly women, who infist on being
painted handsome, and think they shall look better, if the artist gives them a
little more red and white! Such, for the most part, are the historialis of
our times, who sacrifice every thing to the present moment, and their own
interest and advantage; who can only be despised as ignorant flatterers of
the age they live in; and as men, who, at the same time, by their extrava-
gant stories, make every thing which they relate liable to suspicion. If,
notwithstanding, any are still of opinion, that the agreeable should be ad-
mitted in history, let thern join that which is pleasant with that which is
true, by the beauties of style and diffition, instead of foisting in, as is com-

monly done, what is nothing to the purpose.
I will now acquaint you with some things Ι lately picked up in Ionia and

Achaia, from several historiatis, who gave accounts of this war. By the Graces‚
I beseech you, to give me credit for what Iam going to tell you, as I could
swear to the truth of it, if it were polite to swear in a dissertation. One of
these gentlemen begins by invoking the Muses, and intreats the goddeffes to
affist him in the performance : what an excellent setting outl' and how pro·
perly is this form of speech adapted to history ! a little farther on, he com-
pares our emperor to Achilles, and the Persian king to Therfites; not con·
fidering, that his Achilles would have been a much greater man, if he had
killed Hefior, rather than Therfites; if the brave should fly, he who pur.
sues must be braver. Then follows an encomium on himself, shewing how
worthy he is to recite such noble affions3 and when he is got on a little, he
extols his own country, Miletus, adding, that in this he had adled better
than Homer, who never tells us where he was born. He informs us, more-
over, at the end·0f his preface, in the most plain and positive terrns, that
he ss1a11 take care to make the best he can of our own affairs·‚ and, as far as

* Architea ] Dinocrates: the same story is told of him, with some little alteration, by Vi.

nuvium Mention is made of it likewise by Pliny and Strabo·
