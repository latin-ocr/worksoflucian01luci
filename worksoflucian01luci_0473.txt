in the highest esteem here, as the most polite, benevolent, and convivial of

men. Even AEsop, the Phrygian, was here, whom they made use of by
way of buffoon. Diogenes of Sinope had so wonderfully changed his man·

ners in this place, that he married Lais, the harlot, danced and sung, got
drunk, and played a thousand freaks. Not one Stoic did I see amongst them,
they, it seems, were not yet got up to the top of the high 4 hill of Virtue;
and as to Chrysippus, we were told that he was not to enter the issand till
he had taken a fourth dose of hellebore. The Academicians, we heard,
were very defirous of coming here, but they stood doubting and deliberating
about it, neither were they quite certain whether there was such a place as
Elyfium or not3 perhaps they were afraid of Rhadamanthus’s -ξ- judgment
on them, as decifivejudgments are what they would never allow, many of
them, itis reported, followed those who were coming to the issand, but be·
ing too lazy to proceed, turned back when they were got half way.

Such were the principal persons whom Ι met with here. Achilles is had
in the greatest honour among them, and next to him Theseus. With regard
to love-affairs, they think there is nothing ἶ indecent in doing what they
please before every body. As to the boys, Socrates swore he meant no
harm3 and yet, if we credit Narcissus and Hyacinthus, he forswore himself.
The women are common to all; their love is only Platonic. 4 * ⁴*

Two or three days after my arrival I met with the poet Homer, and both
of us being quite at leisure, asked him several questionS, and amongst the
rest, where he was born, that, as 1 informed him, having been long a mat—
ter of dispute amongst us: we were very ignorant, indeed, he said, for
some had made him a Chian, others a native of Smyrna, others of Cofo·
phon3 but that, after all, he was a Babylonian, and amongst them was
called Tigranes, though, after being a hostage in Greece, they had changed
his name to Homer. I then asked him about those of his verses which are
rejected as spuriouS, and whether they were his or not. He said, they
were all his own; which made me laugh at the nonsense of Zenodotus, and

inhabitants of Otaheite. See Hawksworth's Voyage. Lucian‚ indeed, speaks broadly out, and
quite in the Otaheite style.·—Miscent corpora publice δι in conspeEtu omnium, cum mutieribus
