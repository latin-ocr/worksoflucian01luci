JUNOANDJUPITER.

Ι SHOULD be ashamed, Jupiter, to have such a ·“4 son as your’s 3 so ef·
seminate, so drunken; his hair tied up with a bonnet3 always amongst a v
parcel of mad women 3 himself more delicate than any of them 3 dancing to
tabors, pipes, and cymbala-23 and, in short, more like any body else than

his father.
J U P 1 T E R.

And yet this delicate, woman-like creature, with his hair tied up, has not
only subdued Lydia, Thrace, and the inhabitants of Tmolus, but, with his
female army, marched against the Indians, seized their elephants, took pos-
seffion of their country3 and, after a weak resistance‚ led their sovereign
captive ε and this he did, dancing and singing all the time, with spears
made of ivy3 and sometimes, as you say, a little drunk and mad3 and if
any one affronted him, by ridiculing his sacred sites, would bind him with
vine-twigs, or have him torn to picces, as kids are by their dams. These
aetions, you see, are manly, and not unworthy of his father : if, at the same
time, he eats, drinks, sports, and plays, I see no harm in it; especially when
you consider what he must be when he is sober, who can do such things

when he is drunk.
J U N 0.

Ι suppose you will praise him, too, for his invention of the grape3 though
you see how those who use it tumble about, and how abusive they are, drink-
ing even till they run mad with it. Icarius, the very first who tasted the
juice of the vine, was beat to death with clubs, by his own pot-companions.

J U P 1 T E R.

All this is saying nothing to the purpose: it was not the wine, nor Bac-
chus, that was in fault3 it was the excess, drinking more than they ought;
but he that drinks with moderation, is only the merrier, and the better tem-
pered 1 Icarius did not use his companions as they did him. But I see plain>

ly, this is nothing but jealousy ; you find fault with Bacchus, only because
you remember Semele.
