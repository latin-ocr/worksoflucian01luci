344 HERM²0T1MUS.

not Hermotimus, therefore, because his masters fight with ffiadows, and
beat us in our absence, imagine that he has subdued uS, or that our argu-
ments are so easily confuted: this is like children, who build houses and pull
thern down again immediate1y3 or like young archers, who tie little bundles
of straw to the top of a spear, and shoot at them3 if at two yards distance
when, if they chance to hit a straw, they think it a mighty feat indeed: but
the ¹* Persian, or the Scythian shoot not thus; they will do it even on horse.
back, and in full speed3 they wish not for the marl< they aim at, to stand
still and wait for their arrows, but to move about, and fly from thern as fast
as possible; thus they kill all their beasts and birds; if they set up a mark
to try their skill, it is some hard wood that can refist the stroke, some stfield
of tough bull's hide, hoping by such exercise that they may learn to piei-ce
through the arinour of their enemies. Tell your friend, Hermotimus, from
us, ¹good Lycinus, that his masters are only hitting bundles of straw, and
boasting at the same time, that they have conquered so many armed men 3
painting pictures of us, which they fight with, and conquerhxg, overcom-
ing, and then suppofing‚ what is very easy to suppose, that they have con.
quered us: but we may, every one of υς, say of them, as Achilles did of

Hector,

Plato, who was well acquainted with Sicily, brings us a story from thence,
of Gelo of Syracuse, who, it seems, had a stinking breath‚ which he, being
a great monarch, nobody durst tell him 0f; till at length, a foreign woman
met with, and took the liberty to acquaint him how the matter stood; when
the king returned home to his wife, he was extremely angry with her that
she had never mentioned it to him, though she must have known how offen·
sive he was3 but she hoped, she said, he would forgive her, alleging in
excuse, that as she had never known, or conversed closely with any other
man, ssie concluded that every body smelt in the same manner.

Thus might Plato say of Hermotimus, that converfing with Stoics only,
itis no wonder heis a stranger to the breaths of other men; and thus also
might Chryfippus complain, if leaving him unheard, Ijoin the Platonics,
