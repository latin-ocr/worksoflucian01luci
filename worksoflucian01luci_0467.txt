BOOKII.

ROM this tirne our abode in the whale growing rather tedious and dis-
agreeable, not able to bear it any longer, I began to think within my-
self how we might make our escape. My first scheme was to underrnine the
right-handwall, and get out th.ere; and accordingly we began to cut away,
but after getting through about five stadia, and finding it was to no purpose,
we left off digging, and determined to- set fire to the wood‚ which we imagin-

trophy was ereeted. Here we staid three days, it being a dead calm, and·

sor some days we had very mild and temperate weather, but the north-wind
arifing, it grew so extremely cold, that the whole sea was froze up, not on
the surface only, but three or four hundred feet deep, so that we got out
and walked on the ice. The frost being so intense that we could not bear it, we
put in przffiiice the following scheme, which Scintharus put us in the head of:
we dug a cave in the ice, where we retuained for thirty days, lighting a fire,
