PYTHAGORAS.

How do you count ?
B Ι D D E R.

 

One, two, three, four

P Y T H A G O R A S.
There now 3 you see: what you call ff four are ten, the perfect triangle‚

and our great oath.
B 1 D D E R.

Now, by the great oath, the holy four, never did Ι hear such sacred and

divine discourse.
P Y T H A G o R A s.

After this, stranger, I will instruet thee concerning the earth, and the
water, and the fire, what their ae‘tion is, what their body, and how they

are moved.
B Ι D D E R.

Have fire, ait, and water, a shape then?

P Y T H A G Ο R A S.
Most manifestly; for without form or body how could they be moved?

hence you will learn that god himself is number and harmony.

Wonderful, indeed! B 1⁴ D D E R·

P Y T H A G O R A S.
Befides this, Ι shall convince you, that you yourself, a seeming individual,
appear to be one, and in reality are another.

B 1 D D E R.
How say you? that Ι, who now converse with you, arn not myself, but

another?
PYTHAGORAS.

At present you are here, but formerly you appeared in another body, and
under another name, and, hereafter‚ you shall be changed into a different

person.

⁸ Four are tem] i. e. ι, 2, 3, 4, make up tem—The Pythagoream, seeing they could not
express incorporeal forms and first principleS, had recourse to numbers. Pom, or the tetrad,
was esteerned the most perse& number, the primary and primogeneous‚ which they called the
root of all things, Ten is the tetra-itys, or great number, comprehending all arithmetical and
harmonical proportion. All uadens, Greeks and Barbarians‚ reckon to that, and no further.
Now the tetrad is the power of the decad, for before we arrive at the perfeciion of the decad,
we find an united perfection in the tetrad‚ the decad being made up by addition of 1, 2, 3, 4.
See Stanley’s History of Philosophy, p. 381.

This whimfical kind of reasoning, as praeiised by the Pythagoreans, was a fine fund of ridi-
cule for the laughing Lucian.
