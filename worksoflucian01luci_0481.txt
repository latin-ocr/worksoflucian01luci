fighting some time without any material advantage on either fide, about noon
we saw just behind them some of the ἥ Caryonautae, whom we found to be
avowed enemies to the †· Colocynthites, who, on their coming up, imme-
diately quitted us, and fell upon them. We hoisted our sail, and got off,
leaving them to fight it out by themselves: the Caryouautae were most pro-
bably the conquerors, as they were more in number, for they had five ships,
which besides were stronger and better built than those of the enemy, being
made of the shells of nuts cut in tWO, and hollowed, every half nut being
fifty paces long. As soon as we got out of their sight, we took care of our
wounded men, and from that time were obliged to be always armed and pre·
pared in case of sudden attack. We had too much reason to fear; for scarce
was the sun set, when we saw about twenty rnen from a desert issand advancing
towards us, each on the back of a large dolphin. These were pirates also 2
the dolphins carried them very safely, and seemed pleased with their bur-
then, neighing like horses. When they came up, they stood at a little dis-
tance, and threw dried cuttle-fish, and crabs-eyes at us; but we, iu return,
attacking them with our darts and arrows, many of them were wounded, and
unable to stand it any longer, they retreated to the issand.

In the middleof the night, t'ne sea being quite calm, we unfortunately struck
upon a halcyon’s nest, of an immense fize, being about fixty stadia in circum-
ference: the halcyon was fitting upon it, and was herself not much less : as
she flew off, she was very near over—setting our strip with the wind of her
wings, and as she went, made a most hideous groauing. As soon as it was
day, we took a view of the nest, which was like a great ssaip, and built of
trees ; in it were five hundred eggs, each of them longer than a hogshead of
Chios. We could hear the young ones croaking within ε so, with a hatchet
we broke one of the cggs, and took the chicken out unfledged; it was big·
ger than twenty vulturs put together.

When we were got about two hundred stadia from the nest, we met with
some surprifing prodigies. A cheuiscus came, and fitting on the prow of
our strip, clapped his wings and made a noise. Our pilot Scintharus had
been bald for many years, when on a sudden, his hair came again. But
what was still more wonderful, the mast of our ship sprouted out, sent forth
several branches, and bore fruit at the top of it, large figs, and grapcs not
