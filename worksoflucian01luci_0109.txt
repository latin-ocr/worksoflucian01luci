To be sure he is a little lame: but he is useful, an excellent artist‚
and has made heaven very fine: he married Venus too, and is highly es-
teemed on her account. Then, for your other children, ss one of thern is
extremely masculine, a perse& mountaineer3 she runs about killing and
eating strangers like the Scythiam, those devourers of human flesti. As to
Apollo, he pretends to know every thing3 to ssxoot, to play upon the harp,
to cure all distempers, and to prophecy; sets up his divination shops at Del-
phos, Claros, and Didymae, and draws in the fools that consult him, giving
them such ambiguous answers as may be interpreted either way, and so
save the credit of his falssioods: this makes him so rich3 for there are
thousands mad enough to be deceived by his tricks ; but those who know
better see through the imposture. This prophet could not foresee that he
should destroy his beloved Hyacinthus3 nor could he foretell that Daphne
would despise him, with all his beauty, and his fine locks. Isee no rea-¹

son, therefore, why you should think your children so much handsomer

than N iobe’s.

1 know why this murtherer of strangers, and this false prophet you talk of,

gives you so much uneafines53 because you cannot bear to see them amongst
the gods : especially when one is so much admired for her beauty, and the

other plays on the harp at the banquet with universal applause.

Now, indeed, Latona, I mustJlaugh; when Marsyas, you knOW, was so

superior to him in the art, that if the Muses had not paffed an unjust sentence,
Marsyas would have flayed him, and not he Marsyas 3 but the poor wretch
was condemned to perissi in his stead. As to your handsome daughter, she
was so beautiful, that after being seen by Aeiaeon, she had him worried to
death by the dogs, for fear he should discover her ugliness 3 not to mention,
that she would hardly a& as a midwife, if she were herself a virgin.

L A T O N A.

You are proud of being the wife of Jupiter, and reigning with him, and
that makes you give yourself such airs ς but Ι shall see you soon whimpering
and crying, when he leaves you here, and rambles down to earth, in the
Ihape of a bull, or a swan.
