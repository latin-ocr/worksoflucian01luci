remarkably fulloflight3 we got on shore, and found on examinationbthat it
was cultivated, and full of inhabitants, though we could not then see any of
them, as night came on. Other issands appeared, some large, others small,
and ofa fiery colour; there was also below these another land with seas,
woods, mountains, and cities in it, and this we took to be our native coun-
try: as we were advancing forwards, we were seized on a sudden bv the
† Hippogypi, for soit seems they were called by the inhabitants; these Hip-
pogypi are men carried upon vulturs, which they ride as we do horses:
these vulturs have each three heads, and are immensely large: you may
judge of their fize, when Ι tell you that one of their feathers is bigger than
the mast of a ffiip. The Hippogypi have orders, it seems, to fly round
the kingdom, and if they find any stranger, to bring him to the king: they
took us, therefore, and carried us before him: as soon as he saw us, he
gueffed by our garb what we were; You are Grecians, said he, are ye not?
We told him we were : and how, added he, got ye hither through the air?
we told him every thing that had happened to us; and he, in return, relat-
ed to us his own history, and informed us, that he also was a man, that his
,name was‡ Endymion, that he had been taken away from our earth in his

sseep, a-nd brought to this place where he reigned as sovereign. That Η spot,
he told us, which now looked like a moon to us, was the earth¹ He defired
us withal, not to make ourselves uneasy, .for that we should soon have every
thing we wanted. {f Ι succeed, says he, in the war which I am now en-
gaged in against the inhabitants of the Sun, you will be very happy here. .
Vse aiked him then, what enemies he had, and what the quarrel was about?

³* Round, fhim'ng, Εὕα] The account which Lucian here gives us of his vifit to the moon,
perhaps, suggested to Bergkrac, the idea of his ingenious work, called, A Voyage to the Moon.

ἦ· Hippogypi] Equi vultures, horse vulturs; from ἵππος, a horse3 and γυψ, a vulture.

Ι Εηιῄιηιίοη.] Lucian, we see, has founded his history on matter of fa& Endymion, we
all know, was a king of Elis, though some call him a shepherd. Shepherd or king, however,

he was so handsome, that the moon, who saw him sseeping on mount Latmos, fell in love with
him. This no orthodox heathen ever doubted: Lucian, who was a free-thinker, laughs in·

deed, at the tale. But has made him ample amends in this history, by creating him emperor
of the moon,

Η <that spon] Modern astronomers are, 1 think, agreed, that we are to the moon just the
-sarne as the moon is to us. Thongh Lucian’s history may be false, therefore his philosophy, we
see, was true.
