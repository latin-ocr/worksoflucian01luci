ῘΜ Ι N E R V A.
. And is he single or not?

MERCURY.

It seems he is not.
M 1 N E R V A.

Has he any taste for military affairS, is he a lover of glory, or a mere

shepherd?
M E R C U R Y.

Icannot say pofitively, but should imagine, as he is young, he must
have some ambition, and would wish to be a conqueror.

V E N U S.

You see, now, I do not complain, or find fault with you for talking with

him in private: Venus has no suspicions of this kind.
M E R —C U R Y.

Her questions were not unlike your's; therefore do not be jealous, or
think me partial to her, because I gave her a plain and fimple answer: but
I see we have paffed over a good many starS, and got a great way on our
journey whilst we were talking3 we are just at Phrygia3 yonder is Ida, and
now Ican see all Gargarus very plainly, and, if 1 am not mistaken‚ your

judge Paris.
J U N O.

WVhere is he? for Icannot see him.

M E R C U R Y.
Look this way, Juno, towards the left; not at the top of the mountain,

but on the fide where you see the cave, and a herd.
J U N ο.
Ῑ do not see any herd there is.

M E R C U R Y.

No? do not you see, even with my finger, some heifers coming down
from the rocks, and a man running after them, with a crook in his hand,
to keep the herd together?

J U N ο.

Now Ι see him, if that is he.

M E R C U R Y.
It· is: and as we are pretty near him, we had better alight upon earth,

and walk, that we may not alarm and terrify him, by flying upon him un-
awares.
