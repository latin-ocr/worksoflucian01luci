HERMOTIMUS. 349.

When every one has got his own, the 4 Alytarches, or one of the Helleno-
dicae‚ Ι sorget which of them, examines the lots of all, as they stand in a
circle, and matches him who has drawn one A, with him who has got the
other, B with Β, and so on, isthe combatants are in even numbers, to four,
eight, twelve, or twenty3 if uneven, five, seven, nine, &c. besides these,
one odd lot, with a letter, is put into the urn, that has no letter answering
to it; whoever draws this, having no corresponding adversary to oppose him,
must stay till all the rest have contended, which is no little advantage to him,
as he remains fresh himself, and is to attack those who are already worn out

with the combat.
L Y C Ι Ν U S.

Stop a moment: this is the very thing which Ι wanted3 we will suppose
there are nine combatants, and each has drawn his lot; do you go round,
for I will make you a judge instead of a spectator, and examine the letters;
you cannot tell which has the odd one, till you have compared them all.

Vv'hyso?

Because whatever letter you might meet with first, you could not poffibly
tell it was that, for it is not marked beforehand with a K, an M, or an I:
When you light upon A, you must look for the other, when upon B, for
the other B that answers to it, and, so on, till you find that single letter which

has no other correspondent to it.

But suppose that comes up first or second, what will you do with it?

L Y C 1 N U S.

What, indeed, Mr. Judge? would you immediately pronounce that to be
the fingle one? or must not you first go through all the letters, to see if any
one of them answers to it? unless you examine all the lots, you cannot be
sure that this is the single one.

H E R M Ο T 1 M U S.

That 1 can very eafily : for if there are but nine, and I find E in the first

or second place, 1 know that he who has this lot must be the single com-

batant.

How so ?
