thy of attention, whilst they most copioussy describe and dwell upon
trifles; which is just as absurd as it would be, not to take notice of, or ad-
mire the wonderful beauty of the ⁴⁶ Olympiam Jupiter, and at the sarne time
to be lavish in our praises of the fine polisti, workmanship, and proportior}
of the base and pedestal.

Ῑ remember one of these, who dispatches the battle at Europus in seven
lines, and spends some hundreds in a long frigid narration‚ that is nothing
to the purpose; fficwing, how·“ a certain Moorish cavalier, wandering on
the mountains in search of water, lit on some Syri-an rustics, who helped
him to a dinner ; how they were afraid of him at first, but afterwards be-
came intimately acquainted with him, and received him with hospitality;
for one of thern, it seems, had been in Mauritania, where his brother bore
arm5.'’ Then follows a long tale, “ how he hunted in Mauritania, and
saw several elephants feeding together3 how he had like to have been de-
voured by a lion ; and how many fiss1 he bought at Caesarea.'’ This admir-
able historian takes no notice of the battle, the attacks or defences, the truces,
the guards on each fide, or any thing else3 but stands from morning to
night looking upon Malchion‚ the Syrian, who buys cheap fifh at Caesarea:
, if night had not come on, I suppose, he would have supped there, as the
† chars were ready. lf these things had not been carefully recorded in the
history, we should have been sadly in the dark, and the Romans would have
had an insufferable losS‚ if Mausarcas‚ the thirsty Moor, could have found
nothing to drink, or returned to the carnp without his supper3 not to men·
tion here, what is still more ridiculous, as how “ a piper came up to them
out of the neighbouring village, and how they made presents to each other,
Mausacas giving Malchion a spear, and Malchion presenting Mausacas with
a buckle.'’ Such are the principal occurrences in the history of the battle of
Europus. One may truly say of such writers, that they never saw the roses
on the tree, but took care to gather the prickles that grew at the bottorn
of it.

Another of them, who had never set a foot out of Corinth, or seen Syria
or Armenia, begins thus, “ it is better to trust our eyes than our ears; I

'most delicate flavour, and is supposed to be of the same nature with our chars in Curnberland,
and some other parts of this kingdom. 1 have ventured, therefore, to call it by this name, till
some modern Apicius can furnish me with a better.
