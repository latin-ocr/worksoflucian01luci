HERMOTIMUS. 341

commends, and rells us it is the only one that leads to the city: but how
‘can I know that he tells me truth, that he has got to the end of his journey?

That he has seen some city, I may grant him, bur whether he has ever been*
at that whe2e you and I wist1 to be, or whether he may have gone to Baby-
lon, and taken that for Corinth, I am still to learn. It is not every one
who has seen a city that has been at Corinth, for Corinth is northe only one:
but what confounds me most is, that as Ι know there is but one Corinth, so
there is but one right and true way to it, and that all the rest will lead us
any where else, any where rather than there, unless one could be foolish
enough to suppose that the way to India, or the Hyperboreans, could lead

us to Corinth.

Therefore, my good Hermotimus, great caution is necessary, both with
regard to the path, and to our leaders in it : we must not here observe the
old ’ss saying‚ “ wherever our feet will carry us, there let us go ;'' for thus,
instead of going into the path that leads to Corinth, we might get to BaC’tra·,
or Babylon: nor must we take our chance and trust to fortune; in length of
time this, perhaps, might bring us there; but in matters of such moment
we must not stand the hazard os the † dye, shut up all our hopes in such a
narrow compass, or, as the gl proverb says, “ cross the Ionian or AEgean
in a wicker boat.'' If, aiming at truth, we miss the mark, Fortune is not to
be blamed, because she stands alone, amongst a thousand falsehoods. Even
ξ Homer’s archer, Teucer I think it was, could not do this, who, when he
{hot at the pigeon, only broke the cord that held it; it is probable, indeed,
that we may hit some thing, but scarce so that, out of all, we should strike
the very thing we aimed at : the danger is, when thus we trust that Fortune
will chuse the best for us, lest we fall into some fatal error, when we have
