C H R Y S Ι P P U S.
And yet that very man was your father ι if you did not know him, there.'
fore, it is plain you do not know your own father.

B Ι D D E R.

True3 but if he was unmaiked‚ Ι should know him well enough. Bur,
inform me; what is the end of all your wisdom, and when you are arrived at
the perfection of virtue, how will you a& ?

C H R Y S 1 P P U S.

Follow nature, and enjoy her bleffings, as riches, health, and so forth:
but first we must labour hard, pore over small written manuscripts, colle&
commentarics, abound in ’ἕξ solecisms and obscurity3 and, tobcrown all, you
can never be a wife man without taking three draughts of hellebore.

B Ι D D E R.
All this is noble, and worthy of a man3 but, tell me, to bea usurer (for
:so you seem to intimate), does that too become the man who is purged with
hellebore, and arrived at the perfectiori of virtue?

C H R Y S Ι P P U S.
Most certainly ι only the wise should be usurers : for to † syllogize, you

know, and to serape together is the same thing : moreover, it becomes the
wise man, not only to take interest, but interest upon interest : for knowest
thou not that there is a first usury, and likewise a second usury, the daughter
of it? you see, therefore, what the‡ syllogism says, if the wise man may

take the first usury, he may take the second3 now he does take the first,
erg0, he may take the second.

B I D D E R.
We may say the same thing then with regard to the stipend you receive

from your pupils, whence it plainly appears, that none but good men take
a reward for teaching virtue.

C H R Y S 1 P P U S.
You are perfectly right3 nor do Ι take it for my own sake, but for the

⁸ Solecisms.] See W'atts’s Logic.

† Tospllogize‚ &eff The wit of this depends on the fimilarity of sound between two Greek
words of different fignifications: but puns, as Addison observes, are untranssatable.

ξ Thespllogism] Lucian’s observation here is no less arch than true, and in ridicule of the
ancient philosophem, tends to ssiew, thatby puzzling syllogism, and false reasoning, men may
prove any thing3 and not only this, butimmediately after, by the same method‚ prove the di-
re& contrary, as appears in the example of the stone which follows.
