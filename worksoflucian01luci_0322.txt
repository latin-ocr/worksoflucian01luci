286 THE T‘YRANT.

when they travel towards these regions, they are all cowards: like unsuccessful
lovers, they still turn back to look on the defired obje&, and wilh for what they
left behind; as this fool just now did, who, in his journey hither, tried to
escape, and, ever since he came, has been wearying you with perpetual
prayers to release him. But I, who have left nothing dear behind me, who ⁴
had no lands, .nor houscS, nor feasts, nor honours, nor statueS, was ready
prepared for you. At the first nod of Atropos, I'leaped up with joy, threw
afide my knife and myleather, ssip-{hod as Ι waS, my last in my han-d, and
without so much as wastiing off the black, I followed immediately, or rather
led the way hither, never once looking behind me. Every thing here is
agreeable to me, and, above all, the equality of condition, which l find in
this place, where one is not above another: here no tribute is demanded, no
creditors gather in their debts, here is no starving in winter, no fickness,
no beating83 but peace on every fide of us ε things, in short, are totally re·
versed3 for here the poor laugh, the rich groanand are tormented.

MICYLLUS-

Ι will tell you: when Ι was upon earth I lived 'near the tyrant, watched
him attentively, and thought him, Ι own, most like a god. WhenI saw
his purple garments, his numerous household, his gold, his cups inlaid
with genis, and his gilt beds, 1 deemed him the happiest of men ι the very
smell of his pompous suppers overcame me: surely he must, I imagined,
be more than mortal, handsomer, and taller by a royal cubit than the rest
of mankind, walking with such solemnity, and striking terror into all be·
holders: but after death, when stripped of all his finery, how ridiculous
did he appearl how did l laugh at my own folly in admir'ing him, in es-
teeming his felic'ity by the smell of his kirchen, and pronounc'ing him
happy, because the blood of a ᾗ {hell-fiili had stained his garment.

No less am 1 diverted with Gnipho, the usurer, that poor miserable crea-
ture, who never, whilst living, enjoyed his riches, and now has left them
to the extravagant Rhodochares‚ his heir at law. Icould not refrain from
laughter, when I called to mind his meagre, dirty face, and forehead,

qtiity, and after them, every Dives was cloathed in purple.
