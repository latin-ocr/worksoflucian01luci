3² TIMON.

10w; a philosopher, Ι suppose, or he would not have uttered such profane

speeches against me.

Don’t you know Timon, the Colyttian‚ the son of Echecratides; he who
used so often to treat us with the choicest vielims ; that grew so rich on a
sudden, and sacrificed whole hecatombs3 the man that celebrated the feasts
os Jupiter with so much splendor ?

Alas! Alas! What a change is here! Is this our honest Timon, the
rich man, that had so many friends about him; how happens it that he
appears thus dirty and miserable3 digging the earth, for hire, Ι imagine, by
the heaviness of his spade?

M E R C U R Y.

To speak the truth, his probsty, humanity, and charity to the poor, have
been the ruin of him; or rather, in saer, his own folly, eafiness of dispo-
sition, and want ofjudgement in his choice of friends ε he never discovered
that he was giving away his all to wolves and ravenS. Whilst these vul-
turs were preying upon his liver, he thought them his best friends, and
that they fed upon him out of pure love and affeffion. After they had
gnawed him all round, ate his bones bare, and, if there was any marrow
in them, sucked it caresully out, they left him, cut down to the roots and
withered; and so far from relieving or affisting him in their turns, would
not so much as know or look upon him. This has made him turn digger3
and here, in his {kin garment, he tills the earth for hire ; afhamed to ffiew
himself in the city, and venting his rage against the ingratitude of those,
wh0, enriched as they had been by him, now proudly pass along, and
know not whether his name is Timon.

He is not to be despised or neglee'tcd, and has but too much reason
to complain. Confidering his condition, Ι sslould be as bad as those exe·
crable ssat'terers, were Ι to forget a man who has offered up so many fat
bullocks and goats on my altars; the sweet favour of which still smelleth
in my nostrils. But Ihave had so much business of late, what with false
swearers, thievcs, and plunderers; and, above all, those who commit sa-
crilege, who are very numerouS, and keep me always on the watch, that
