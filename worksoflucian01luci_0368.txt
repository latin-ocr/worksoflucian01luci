332 HERMOTIMUs.

there is to be no disputation to-day3 the reason it seems is, that he supped
13st night with Eucrates, who gave a treat on his daughter's birth-day, talked
much at the feast, ‘and entered into a warm debate with Euthydemus, the
Peripatetic, about something in which he and the Stoic' seldom agree3 the
noise made his head ach, there was a deal of contest, and the dispute, they
say, lasted tm midnight3 he had drunk, I suppose, besides, a little too

much, provoked to it by the company, as is usual on these occasions, and
eat more, withal, than an old man should ; when he came home he cascaded

plentisully, it seemS, and seraping together the remnants, which he had

A gohier, sacred to the Pylian kings,
From eldest times; emboss’d with studs of gold.
Two feet support it, and four handles hold;
On each bright handle, bending o’er the brink,
In sculptur’d gold, two turtles seem'd to drink5
A mass'y weight, yet heav’d with ease by him. See Pope’s Iliad, b. xi. l. 773.
