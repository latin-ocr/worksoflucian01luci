440 x THE TRUE HtsToRY,

roeffa. He seleeted three of the bravest of our crew to accompany them ;
never mentioning> the defign to his father, who he knew would never consent
to it ; but, the first favourable opportunity, put it in execution, and one night,
when Ι was not with them (for it happened that 1 staid late at the feast, and
ssept there), carried her off. Menelaus, rising in the middle of the night,
and perceiving that his wife was notin bed with him, made a dreadful noise
about it, and, taking his brother along with him, proceeded immediately
to the king’s palace. At break of day the guards informed him that they
had seen a veffel, a good distance from land : he immediately put fifty heroes
on board a ship, made out of one large piece of the asphodelus, with orders
to pursue them. They made all the sail they poffibly could, and about
noon came up with, and seized on them, just as they were entering into the
milky sea, close to Tyroess'a3 so near were they to making their escape: the
pursuers threw a rosy chain over the veffel, and brought her home again.
Helen began to weep, blushed, and hid her face. Rhadamanthus asked
Cinyrus, and the rest of them, if they had any more accompliees : they told
him, they had none3 he then ordered them to be chained, whipped with
mallows, and sent to Tartarus.

It was now determined that we should stay no longer on the issand than
the time limited3 and the very next day was fixed for our departure: this
gave me no little concern, and 1 wept to think I must leave so many good
things, and be once more a wanderer. They endeavoured to administer
consolation to me, by afl'uring me that in a few years I should return to thern
agaim they even pointed out the seat that should be allotted to me, and
which was near the best and worthiest inhabitants of these delightful ,man-
fions. 1 addreffed myself to Rhadamanthus, and humbly intreated him to
inform me of my future fate, and let me know, beforehand, whether Ι
should travel: he told me, that after many toils and dangers‚ l should at
last return in sasety to my native country, but would not point out the time
when : he then shewed me the neighbouting issands, five of which appeared
near to me, and a fixth at a distance3 those next to you, said he, where
you see a great fire buming, are the habitations of the wicked; the fixth is
the chy of‹heaffm; behhuithat hesthe thd of Cahqsso, ndnch you
