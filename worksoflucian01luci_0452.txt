416 THETRUEHISTORY.

ceived such vifible marks of Bacchus's presence here. As 1 had a mind to
know whence this river sprung, Ι went back to the place from which it
seemed to arise, but could not trace the spring3 Ι found, however, several
large vines full of grapes, at the root of every one the wine flowed in great
abundance, and from thern, I suppose the river was collexited. We saw a
great quantity of fifh in it, which were extremely like wine, both in taste
and colour, and after we had taken and eat a good many of them we found
ourselves intoxicated3 and when we cut thern up, observed that they were

full of grape stones3 it occurred to us afterwards that we should have mixed
them with some water fifh, as by themselves they tasted rather too strong
of the wine.

We passed the river in a part of it which was fordable, and a little farther
on met with a most wonderful species of vine, the bottoms of thern that
touched the earth were green and thick, and all the upper part most beauti-
ful women‚ with the limbs perse& from the waist, only that from the tops

of the fingers branches sprung out full of grapeS, just as Daphne is represent-
ed as turned into a tree when Apollo laid hold on her; on the head, likewise,
instead of hair they had leaves and tendrils ; when we came up to thern they
addreffed us, some in the Lydian tongue, some in the Indian, but most of
them in Greek3 they saluted us also, and, which was remarkable, whoever
they kiffed reeled about as if he was drunk3 they would not suffer us to taste
their grapes, but when any body attempted it, cried out as if they were
²* hurt. -----

We left them and returned to our companions in the ship, to whom we
related every thing that had happened to us, not forgetting our little intrigue
with the vines. We then took our casks, filled some of thern with wa-
ter, and some with wine from the river, ssept one night on shore, and the
next morning set sail‚ the wind being very moderate. About noon, the issand
being now out of sight, on a sudden a most violent whirlwind arose, and
carried the ssiip above three thousand stadia, lifting it up above the water,
from whence it did not let us down again into the seas but kept us {v suspended
in mid air, in this manner we hung for seven days and nights, and on the
