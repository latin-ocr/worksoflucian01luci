342, HERMOTIMUS:

loosed our anchor and set fail, we cannot always return in safety, but may
‘be rost ÷bout at sea, suffer head-ach, fickness, and a thousand terrors: when

ght‚ before we left the harbour, to have seated ourselves on an emi-

nence, and seen whether the wind was fair sor Corinth, chosen an able pilot,

&VC (33¹,

and provided a well-built veffel‚ that could weather a storm.

It would certainly be most prudent: but Ikn0w‚ after all, if you go
through the whole circle, you will never find better leaders, or more expett
pilots than the Stoics: if you wish to get to Corinth, follow them; walk
after Zeno and Chrysippus, or you will never do it.

L Y C I N U S.
This is all old and trite, Hermotimus3 those who follow Plato and Epi-

curus sayjust the same thing, every one tells me I shall never arrive at Co·
rinth without him: thus Imust either give credit to 311, which would be
absurd and ridiculous, or to neither of them ; and this is certainly the safest
way, till we can find out somebody that will specil: truth. For only sup-
pose that, ignorant of it as Iam now, I should embrace your opinion, and
sepose confidence in you as my friend, you, who are attached to the Stoic
dofitrines, 3ηά will acknowlege no other3 suppose that, after this, some god
should call back to life Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras, and the rest of them3
‘suppose they should bring me before their tribunal, should 311 surround me,
and say,—how comes it, friend Lycinus, that you have thus preferred to us
Zeno and Chrysippus, those men of yesterday, without ever consulting us,
or attending to our arguments? how could Ianswer them? Would it be
sufficient to say, Ι relied on Hermotimus, my old friend and companion ι we
know him not, might they reply, nor is he ac {uainted with us; you ought
not, therefore, thus to have condemned us, absent and unheard3 you ought
not to have placed such confidence in 3 man who Knows but one sect, and
that imperfect1y3 it is not thus our lawgivers instruet their judges, nor do
they permit thern to hear one fide only, and not the other, but to give equal
‘attention to both, that the arguments os each being carefully weighed and
considered, they may discern truth from falsehood3 and this, if they do not
perform, the law allows them to appeal to another—iudicatum.

Thus, perhaps, my friend, would they inter ogare me. Suppose, again,
one of them should say,--W⁷hat think you, Lycinus, if an AEthiopian‚ who
had never been out of his own country, or seen such men as we are, should

affert,
