Now give me the condemned malefactors‚ those who were beat to death

with clubs, and those who were crucified. Sixteen, Ithink, were mur·
thered by robbers ε where are they ?

M E R C U R Y.
There they are, covered with wounds, as you see. Shall 1 bring the wo-

mennow?
C L O T H O.

By all means, and those who were shipwrecked, for they all periffied to-
gether, and in the same manner. Now, give me those who died of severs,
and with them Agathocles the phyfician ι but where is Cyniscus the philo-
sopher, who was to die for eating Hecate's supper, sacred egge, and raw

onions?
CYNISCUS.

Ι have been here some time: but wherefore‚ Clotho, would you leave
rne so long upon earth ? my ,thread was well nigh spun, I often endeavoured
to cut it, but, I know not why, could not succeed..

C L O T H O.

I had left you to take care of mankind, and cure them of their wicked-

ness: but come along3 you are welcome here, and happy may you be!
C Y N I S C U S.

I ccme3 but let me first ‚deliver safe to you our prisoner here: I am afraid
his intreaties will over-persuade you to release him,

Let me see him : who is he?

M E R C U R Y.
Megapenthes, the tyram: of Lacidos.

C L Ο Τ Η Ο.
Come along.

Spare me, good Clotho, and let me return to the other world, only for
a {hort time. 1 will come to you again presently, without sending for.

C L O T H Ο.
What do you want to go back for ?
