2 THEDREAM.

his time, Whilst you are here, says he, we ought by no means to prefer any
art to your& take him, therefore, along with you, and make a good sculptor
of him3 he will do very well, for you know he has a natural turn and genius
for it, This my father imagined from having seen some little things I made
out of wax, when, after school—time, I used to divert myself with modelling
horses, oxen, and sometimes men, which he seemed'mightily pleafed at, and
for which, by the bye, Ι was often whipped by my school-master. My fa-
ther’s friends, however, took this opportunity of exciting my ambition3 and
all conceived, from this natural propenfity to the art, that Ishould soon ae<
quire the perfect knowlege of it; no time, it was determined, could be more
proper to enter upon it than the present, and I was accordingly delivered over

to my uncle, to which 1 had not then the least objection: I considered it as

a kind of agreeable amusement to be able to gain some reputation in
the world, and at the same time to oblige my friends by carrying out images
osgods or men, to adorn their irenses, or my own3 a custom, Ι knew, always
praeiised by young beginners. My uncle took me home with him, and gave
me a piece of marble, bidding me run over it gently with my tool, and
repeating at the same time the old adage of “ Γ’ a good beginning is half
“ the work.'’ Iknew little of the matter, and preffing too hard on the
marble, broke it in pieces. My uncle flew into a violent passion, and takf
ing up a switch that happened to lay near him, with no great tenderness
{cll upon, and belaboured me pretty handsomely, by way of † initiating me
into the art. Thus were tears the first fruits of my profesfion. Ι ran away
home as fast as I could, crying and bawling, shewed the marks of the
switch upon my flesti, represented the barbarity of my uncle3 and, more-
over, took care to insinuate that he did it merely through envy, and for
sear lshould excel him in his art. My mother resented it highly, and railed

³* A good bcginrzz‘ng, δικ] Lucian attributes this saying to Hefiod, in whose Works, however,
it is not at present, l believe, to be found. We meet with it in Plato, Aristode, Dionyfius
os Halicarnaffis, and some other Greek writers. Horace has adopted it in his

Dimidium faeti qui cepit habet.

There is likewise a proverb of our own which bears some similitude to it: ‘⁴ A good beginning
‘⁴ makes a good ending ;'’ but this is not the exact sense of the Greek, 1 have therefore not
ventured to adopt it. Ovid has nearly the same sentiment,

Fuc tanturn incipias, sponte disertus eris.

formed at sacrifices just before the viCtim was ssain.
