Take him away, and speed you well with him, Now, EpicuruS‚ ‚I must
call you. Who buys him ? This, gentlemen‚ is a ‡ disciple of the laugh-
iug philosopher, and the drunken one, whom I just now put up to sale: he
has the advantage of them both in one thing, that he has more wickedness

⁸ If they could, ἐξα] See Stanley's Plato. The Platonic doetrine of ideas is, to say the
nuth, very obscure and unintelligible, as may be seen by consulting the works of that philoso-
pher, and Lucian has accordingly represented it in the most ridiculous light.

† Dion quyraczfiu] See Cornelius Nepos’s Life of Dion. Diodorus Siculus tells uS, that
Plato was soldin Sicily for twenty minae. Book xv, p. 461.

ξ Α disciple, ξεέιη] Epicurus is called a disciple of Democritus, because he adopted his the-
ory of atoms ; and of Aristippus also, because his ideas of sensual pleasure were supposed to co-

incide, in a great measure, with those of that celebrated philosopher. M R
