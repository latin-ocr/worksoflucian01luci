TnnSCYTHIAN. 383

considered him as their great legissator, and implicitly obeyed him, al—
ways loving and valuing those whose condufi't he applauded. Anacharsis
was, moreover, initiated into the sacred mysteries, the only barbarian who
ever enjoyed that privilege, having before been made a denizen of Athens;
if we may believe Theoxenus, who relates this of him : nor would he ever,
Ι suppose, have returned into Scythia, if the death of Solon had not driven
him out of Greece.

And, now, you will expetit, no doubt, that Ishould put an end to my tale,
and inform you for what purpose I brought Toxaris and Anacharsis thus out
out of Scythia, and old Solon to Athens : the truth is, something parallel to
Anacharfis’s adventures happened to myself; by the Graces, I beseech you,
my friends, be not angry at the fimile, or because Ι compare myself to a
man of such rank and family, he was a barbarian as well as myself, and, Ι
hope, you will own, a Syrian is not inferior to a Scythian. 1 do not rnean to
draw the comparison with regard to his birth, but to other circumstances3
for, when Ifirst came an utter stranger to your city, I was struck with the
fize and beauty of it, the number of its inhabitants, its dignity, and splendor.
1 was astonished, and lost in admiration, like the ³⁶ young man at the palace
of Menelaus τ and well I might be at the sight of a city so grand, noble, and
flourishing.

In this situation, Ι considered what I should do3 Ihad resolved to give you
a specimen of my abilities as an orator ; how indeed could 1 pass over in fi-
lence, such a subject! 1 enquired, therefore, (for Ι will confess the truth)
who were the principal men in the city, to whom I might apply, as patrons,
who would be of the greatest service to me : very soon, nor one or two bar-
barians, like Toxaris and Anacharsis, but numbers3 all, indeed, whom I
met, told me the same thing; however, though in different words, Know,
stranger, they all cried, there are in this city many good and senfible men,
nor will you find so many, perhaps, any where else; but there are two, supe-
rior in rank and dignity, as well as in goodness to all the rest, in learning
and elegance, equal to the ten famous orators of Greece ; such favourites of
the people, that they are universally beloved, which is the greatest happiness
to the commonwealth : whatever they command is performed, for they com-
mand nothing but what is good ε great as they are, they leave no room for
envy3 respectable for their kindness, benevolence‚ and hospitality3 at tlze
