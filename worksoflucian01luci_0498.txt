to do it often, to do it inconfiderately, and to do it perpetually, is going

beyond the paternal authority.”
Do not, therefore, I beseech you, reverend j'udges, permit him, after he

ha h of his own accord received me back, cancelled his resentment, and an-

nulled the formerjudgment‚ again to inflict the same punishment on me,
to recur once more to that pater-nal authority which is now spent and con·
sumed. You very well know, that in courts ofjudicature, where the judges
are appointed by lot, if any man thinks himself injured by the sentence paffed,

the law permits him to appeal to another tribuna13 but when rnen appoint
their own judges, and refer the cause to them, there can be no fai-ther ap-

peal, and if of your own accord you chuse those very persons whose judg-

ment you did not before consent to abide by, with their determination you
must remain contented. In like manner you also, my father, whom you
should not have received back, if he seemed unworthy of being admitted in-
to your family, him, whom, notwithstanding you so well approved as to
take horne again, you cannot now send into banishment ε you have yourself
borne witness ¹that he harh not deserved this of you, you have acknowleged
his merit and virtue. It is therefore indispenfibly neceffary that you confirm
the reconciliation, and own that the reception you have given him canno

when you cast me out from you, and ¹the other, when having changed your
opinion, you reversed t-he sentence, rescinded your former decree, and ad-
hered to your last resolution, Remain therefore in that opinion, defend and
preserve your ownjudgment3 be indeed a father Ξ; this determination was

agreeable to you, this you have approved of, this you have ratified.
Nor do I think, that ifl had not been your real, but only your adopted

son, you were at liberty to banish and difinherit me. What is once done,
can never be undone. Him‚ therefore, who was by nature intitled to your
house and inheritance, and whose right you, moreover, confirmed by your
mvn will, and your own ειξὶς how can you expel‚ how can you deprive him
again and again of the same privileges? Suppose I had been assave, and
thinking me guilty of some crime, you had bound and imprisoned me; that
afterwards changing your opinion, and convinced of my innocence, you had
unbound and made me free; could you ever, if again angry with, have made
assave of me? by no means: the'law, you know, in these caseS, makes the

freedom perpetual. lcould add much more to prove, that when the ba·
