1 will, and return to my snbjeft. He began with an eulogium on Greece,
and those who dwell at Athens, preferring philosophical indigence to every
thing befide; never rejoicing in the company of either citizens or strangers,
who would lead them afide into the parhs of pleasure3 but if they met
with any such, would soon transform them, teaching them how to change
their ancient manners, and walk in purity of life. He then mentioned one
of those fine gentlemen, who came to Athens, dreffed out in gold and filver,
with a large attendance, and who thought himself the admiration of all
men, and that he was the happiest of human beings; but to them the crea·
ture appeared miserable: -they tried however to reform him, not by open
and sharp reproaches·‚ as if a man in a free city might not live as he thought
proper; but when at any time he grew troublesome, either at the baths, or
wrestling places of public exercise, crouding in with a heap of servants, and
preffing people ro death, would put somebody in his way, that, in an hurn-
ble voice, and unwilling to offend him, should whisper, “ This man sure
is afraid of being murthered in the bath, though, as it is the seat of per-
petual peace, there is no occasion for an army there.’' He hears what is
said of him, andis the better sor it; they persuaded him, withal, to lay
aside his fine purple robe, and all his gaudy apparel, by sneering at the
tawdriness of it : the spring is approaching, they cried, whence comes this
peacock? Perhaps the gown is his mother's, and so forth. In like manner
they reproved the rest of his follies‚ sometimes laughing at the quantity of
rings on his fingers, sometimes his extraordinary nicety in the dreffing of his
hair, and sometimes his extravagant manner of living3 thus, by degrees,
was he reformed, and went away apparently a much better man than he
came. To shew that philosophers were never ashamed of their poverty, he
told me a story, which was current at the public games, of a man, who
appearing there in a * coloured robe, was seized on, and carried before the
president of the games; many of the people took compaffion on, and in-
terceded for him: but, when the crier pronounced him guilty of asting

ἃ Coloured robc‚] The privilege of putting on a fine coloured robe was one of the rewards

with which the conquerors at the Olympics were honoured ; it was consequently considered as a
crime to appear in thern before the combat.
