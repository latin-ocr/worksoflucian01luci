TmchTHIAN. 381

could speak his language, and seemed to know him so well ; how came you,
said he, stranger, to know me? Iam your countryman, replied the other,
though, being of inferior rank, you do not recolle& me; my name is Toxa-
ris. And are you, said Anacharsis, that Toxaris whom Ι have heard so much
of, who left his wife and family in Scythia, in search of Grecian literature,
and came to Athens, where he now lives honoured and revered by the great-
est persons in it? I am he, said Toxaris. Know then, replied Anacharsis,
that Ι am your disciple and follower; struck with the same paffion as your-
self for Grecian knowlege, Ileft my native country, and have suffered sov
many hardihips in myjourney hither, that ifl had not lit on you, I had de-

termined, before sun-set, to go back to my ship, such uneafiness did I feel

at being totally ignorant of every thing around me3 but, by our country’s

gods, by Zamolxis, and the * scymitar, 1 now intreat thee, Toxaris, to take

a stranger under thy protection, lead me round the city, and ffiew me every
thing that is worth seeing in it; explain to me the laws of Athens, her manners,

her rites and ceremonies, her poliey, and customs; bring me acquainted
with her great men, shew me all those things which induced you, as well as
myself‚ to take so long a journey, and do not suffer me to return home with·
out a thorough knowlege of them.

It was not (replied Toxaris), like a lover of science, after coming to the
very door, thus to talk of retreating3 be of good courage, however, my
friend, for you than not go back so soon as you intended; this city will not
so eafily part from you, nor does it want allurements sufficient to detain 3
stranger in it, but will lay hold on you so strongly, that you will soon forget
even your wife and children, if you have left any behind you. And, now,
1 will tell you how you may get a complete view of Athens, and of every
thing remarkable throughout all Greece; there is here a great and wise man,
a native of this place, who has travelled through Afia and AEgypt, well
known to the first persons in the kingdom, though he is himself poor and -
indigent3 you will find him old, like me, and habited like a plebeian, yet,
on account of the extraordinary wisdom, and many virtues which he poffeffes,
admired and esteemed by all the citizens, who aeknowlege him as their le·-
gissator, and live and aet as he directs them: if you can make him your
friend, and experience how great a man he is, you will have in him alone,
all Greece; the summit and perfection of every thing that is to be seen ott
