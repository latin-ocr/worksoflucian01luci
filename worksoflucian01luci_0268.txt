’Χ- on the outfide. In this condition you {hall say you are happier than the
† great king. If any body beats or torments you, you shall think it no
hardffiip, nor complain of it.

B I D D E R.
How ! not complain when 1 am beaten: 1 have not the {hell of a crab or

a tortoise.
D 1 Ο G E N E S.

You shall say, with a very little alteration, what Euripides did.

VVhat’s that? B I D D E R·

‡ My mind is hurt, but my tongue shall not complain. But now, mind
how you are to behave: you must be bold, saucy, and abufive to every
body, kings and beggars alike3 this is the way to make them look upon
you, and think you a great man. Your voice should be barbarous, and your
speech dissonant, as like a dog as poffible; your countenance rigid and in-
flexible, and your gait and demeanor suitable to it: every thing you say
savage and uncouth: modesty, equity‚ and moderation you must have no·
thing to do with : never suffera bluffi to come upon your cheek: seek the
most public and frequented place, but when you are there defire to be alone,
and permit neither friend nor stranger to associate with you 3 for these things
are the ruin and destruction of power and empire. Do that boldly‚ before
every body, which nobody else would do even in §private‚ and let your
amours be as r'idiculous as poffible: at length, if you chuse it, you may die
with eating a raw Η polypus, or an onion. And this felicity I heartily wilh

you may attain to.

ἃ On the outfide.] People of fassiion never wrote but on the infide of the parchment, though
tlte poorer sort made use of the outfide also. Juvenal alludes to this in his first Satire‚

Scriptus et in tergo, &c.
ἡ· *The great kingss] The king of Perfia,

Μεγας δε Bao-meve εχι δια ‘terror κομα;
Aristophanes in his Plutus, ver. ¹70·

So Horace also,
Persarum vigui rege beatior.
ἶ My mind, iffa] See the Hippolytus of Euripides, v. 612.
ξ In private.] Qid ego de Cynicis loquar? says LactantiuS‚ quibus in propatulo coire cum
conjugibus mos fuit? Sic Crates curn uxore palam in poecile rem habuit.

Η A razo polypus] Alluding to the death of Democritus, who, some say, died in this manner.
Laertius, however, assures υς, that he lived to the age of a hundred, and died of old age.
