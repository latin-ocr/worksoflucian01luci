TIMON. 45

gold: what virgin would not spread forth her bosom to receive so beautiful 3
lover? O Midas, Croesus, and all ye Delphic offerings, how little are ye,
when compared to Timon, and his riches? The Persian king cannot boast
of equal affluence. You, my spade and blanket, 111311 be hung up as my vo-
tive acknowlegements to the great deity. I will purchase some retired spot,
there build 3 tower to keep my gold in, and live for myself alone ε this 111311
be my habitati0n3 and, when I am dead, my sepulchre also: from this
time forth, it is my fixed resolution, to have no commerce or connection
with mankind, but to despise and avoid it: 1 will pay no regard to ac-
quaintance, friendship, pity, or compaffion: to pity the distreffed, or to
relieve the indigent, Ι 111311 confider as a weakness‚ nay, as a crime: my
life, like the beasts os the field, 111311116 'spent in solitude, and Timon alone
111311 be Timon’s friend. Ι will treat all befide as enemies and betrayers; to
converse with them were profanation, to herd with them impiety: accursed
be the day *that brings them to my sight : I will look upon men, in short, as
no more than so many statues of brass or stone3 will make no truce, have no
conneffion with them: my retreat 111311 be the boundary to separate us for
ever. Relations, friends, and country, 316 empty names, respeoted by
fools alone. Let Timon only be rich, and despise all the world befide3 ab·
horring idle praise, and odious flattery, he 111311 be delighted with himself
alone: alone shall 116 sacrifice to the gods, feast alone, be his own neigh-
bour, and his own companion. I am determined to be alone for life, and,
when I die, to place the crown on my own head3 the fairest name I would
1111111 to be distinguished by, is that of misanthrope. I would be known and
marked out by my asperity of manners, by moroseness, cruelty, anger, and

inhumanity. Were Ι 10 see a man perishing in the flames, and imploring me

to extinguish thern, I would throw pitch or 011 into the fire to encrease it:

or, if the winter flood should overwhelm another, who, with outstretched

hands should beg me to affist him, I would plunge him still deeper in the
stream, that he might never rise again ; thus 1113111 be revenged of mankind,

.... What’s here ?

Gold, yellow‚ glittering‚ precious gold? Why this

Will lug your priests and servants from your fides;

Will knit and break religions‚ bless the accurs’d,

Make the hoar leprosy adored‚ place thieves‚

And give them title, knee, and approbarim,

With senators on the bench. shakspear’s Timon, a& iv· scene iii.
