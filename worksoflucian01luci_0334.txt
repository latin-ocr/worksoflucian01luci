indeed, ἥ TheogniS, take your advice, and leap into the deep ocean, or
hurl themselves down from the steep precipice! Most certain, however, it is,
that he who is always poor, always begging, and always a ssave, and yet
fancieS, all the time, he is escaped from poverty‚ can only be impofing on,
and deceiving himself.

Some allege that they should not be under any sear of poverty if they
could get their bread by labour, like other men; but that being incapable,

from age and infirmities, they are forced to let themselves out in this man·
ner. Let us see, then, whether this be really so, and what reward they
have for their labours, which are at least as great, if not greater, than any
other set of men whatever. To get money without toil‚ or trouble, would

affectation os luxury and extravagance. Hence it is that their patrons treat
them as proud mistreffes do their lovers, just grant them enough to keep
up their affeffron, but with-hold the ‡ last favour, as well knowing that paffion
