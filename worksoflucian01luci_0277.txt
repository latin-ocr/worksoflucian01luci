in his own mind to restore him or not: what would you say was the croco-

dile's resolution ?
B 1 D D E R.

You have alked me a question not easy to be resolved, nor can Ι poffibly
answer it. I beseech you answer it yourself; lest, before Ι atn able to do ir,

my boy should be devoured.

C H R Y S I P P U S.
Never fear: I will teach you more wonderful things than this.

BIDDER.

What are they ?
C H R Y S 1 P P U S.

⁹ss The reaper, the ruler, the Elee‘ssa, and the mask.

B 1 D D E R.
What do you mean by the mask, and the Eleena?

C H R Y S 1 P P U S.
I mean Elestra, the famous daughter of Agamemnon; who knew some·

thing, and at the same time knew it not. When Orestes stood before her
undiscoveted, she knew Orestes was her brother, but stre knew not that he

who stood before her was Orestes.
But now you shall hear the mask, that most admirable of all syllogisms·

Answer me, now, do you know your own father ?

BIDDER.

Aye,sure.
C HRYS I PPUS.

Suppose then a man standing before you massted, and Ι assz you, do you

know this man? What would you say?
B 1 D D E R.
Certainly ε that I did not know him.

⁰ The reaper, δῖα] “ Sophismatis hujus (says the famous annotator M. du S.) meminerunt
alii antiqui scriptores, nemo autem exemplum affert unde certo quid fuerit, constet :⁹⁹ and zi little
after, speaking os t'ne ruler, “ hujus, says he, Diog. Laert. oblitus videtur, nec quid- fit, con-
jeeItura assequi poffum.” M. du S. we see fairly, acknowledges, with regatd to both the reaper
and the ruler, that he cannot tell what they were, nor does he know how to explain them,
Itis atassz, therefore, whichI {hall not presume to undertake: though, by taking painfully
into the dust ofantiquity‚ all these strange riddles might probably be solved: but the reader, Ι
hope, will think with me, that, “ il ne vant pas la peine.” Chrysippus and his followers had, we

{iiietilaughs at ε these were adopted and improved upon by our schoolmen in the fourteenth and

fifteenth centuries.
