Eren so, Notus3 and, Mercury says, is to preside over marinerS, and to
be our mistresS, and we must blow or not as lhe commands us,

N O T U S.
By jove then, Zephyrus, it well becomes us to pay our court to her, that

sne may be the kinder to us.

Z E P H Y R U S.
See, {he is got over, and swam to land3 observe, she no longer goes on

four feet, Mercury has changed her into a most beautiful woman.

N O T U S.
This is wonderful, indeed, Zephyrus: she has no horns or tail, or cloven

feet, but looks like a charming girl ε and see, Mercury is changed too, and
instead, of appearing as a youth, has put on the face of a dog.

VVelh do not let us be too curious: he knows best what he is about.

DIALOGUE XXXIX.

NEPTUNE ΛΝΒ ENIPEUs.

E N I P E U S.
IT was not handsome of you, Neptune, for 1 will speak the truth, to
come in my ssiape, and seduce my mistress: she ὕ took you for me, and

therefore complied.

ἃ Tookyoufhr me, Εὕα] Enipeus was a river, which took its source from a village near Sal·
mone, in the neighbourhood of the ocean.
As on his banks the maid enamour’d roveS,
Ί he monarch of the deep beholds, and loves ;
ln her Enipeus’ form, and borrow'd* charms,
The am'rous god descends into her arms.
See Pope’s transsation of the Odyffey, book xi. l. 287.

The good bissrop Eustathius makes the following observation on this pass'age: ‘⁶ It was custo-
mary, (says he) for young virgins to resort frequently to rivers, to bathe in them3 and the
ancients have very well explained these fables about the intercourse between them and the
water-gods. “ Receive my virginity‚ O Scamander,” says alady; but it is very apparent who
this Scamander was ; her lover, Cyrnon, lay concealed in the reeds. This was a good excuse
for female frailty in an age of credulity.'’

I do not rernember that this little piece of gallantry, between Neptune and Miss Tyr0, 1¹³⁵
attracted the notice of any ancient writer except Homer and Lucian·
