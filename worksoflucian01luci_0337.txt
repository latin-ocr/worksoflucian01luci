redounds to their honour. Then begins the affair to appear of the utmost con-
sequence to you, as if your very life and being were concerned in the deter-
mination. Itis, indeed, a most serious matter; for if you are rejected as
*unworthy by your first patron, you can never be received by another. Your
mind, therefore, must be distra&ed‚ and torn to pieces, partly from the
envy you bear to those who are examined with you (for we will suppose
many others in‘the same situation), and partly from your fear of not acquit-
ting¹yourse1fs0 well as you might have done3 then arise hopes and fears in
abundance, and you rivet your eyes upon him ε if he seems to dissike what
you say, you look upon yourself as undone3 but is he listens with a gracions
smile, your hopes are raised, and you are mightily rejoiced. In the mean
time, it is very probable, you may meet with enemies, that will traduce
and send out their ³⁵ arrows against you in secret; some man with a long
heard and white hair shall be fought for, and asked if he knows of any thing
particular, and there will always be found others that will give him credit.
Then all your past life must be carefully enquired into; and if any of your
good neighbours, either incited by envy, or who has⁸ received some ssight
affront from you, shall say you are a pathic‚ or adulterer, he shall be called
a † witness from the court of Jove: but if, on the other hand, all unite to
praise and recommend you, then they are looked upon as very doubtful evi-
dence, or false and corrupted : you must be very fortunate, indeed, and meet
with no oppofition, if you succeed. We will suppose then, that every thing
goes right, that the great man approves your speech, and that his most res-
pee‘ced friends, whose opinion he always takes on these occasions, do not
endeavour to set him against you3 that his wife likes, that his steward and
house-keeper do not oppose you, that no body finds fault with your life and
manners, but that every thing is expiated and atoned for. At length then,
happiest as thou art of men, thou hast conquered', thou art crowned at the
‡ Olympio games, or rather, as I may say, thou hast taken Babylon, and
the tower of Sardis is surrendered to thee: thou shalt poffess the Amalthaean
