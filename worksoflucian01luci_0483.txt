and totally routed; we ssew about fifty of them, and took two prisoners,
whom we returned with. All this time we could get no provision: some
were for putting thc captives to death ε but not approving of this, l kept
them bound, till the enemy should send ambassadors to redeern them, which
theydid; for we soon heard them lowing in a melancholy tone, and most
humbly beseeching us to release their friendS. The ransom agreed on, was a
quantity of· cheeses, dried fifh, and onionS, together with four stags, each
having th'ree feet, two behind and one before. In consideration of this, we
released the prisoners, staid one day there, and set fail.

We soon observed the fifh swimming and the birds flying round about us,
with other figns of our being near the land 3 and in a very little time aster,
saw some men in thesea, who made use of a very uncommon method of sail-

dreffed, like so many harlots, and with great freedom came up to and em—
braced us: every one took her man home with her, to entertain him. Ἰ he

issand was called *ff* Cabalusa, and the city Hydamardia. I stopped a little,
for my mind misgave me, and looking round, saw several bones and skulls of
men on the ground; to make a noise, call my compauions together, and
take up arms, I thought would be imprudent. I pulled out my ξς maflow,

make nothing of. Various, however, are the derivations, and numerous the guesses made about
them.·st-The English reader may, if he pleases, call them not improperly, especially the first,
