PARRHESIADES.

You see how few of thern obey the summons ; they are afraid of Justice;
befides, that rnost of thern are so busy about the grear, they cannot find
time to come. If you have a mind to bring them all together, you must
harangue them thus -—

P H Ι L O S O P H Y.

Well, do you call thern then yourself.

PARRHESIADES.
Nothing so easy. SiIence, there! Let all those, who call themselves phi-

losophers, and go by that name, repair immediately to the Acropolis, to ’
partake ofa public donation. To each man will be given two minae, and a
cake of Indian corn. Whoever has a very long heard, shall be intitled to a
basket of figs into the bargain. Of wisdom, temperance, orjustice, they
need not bring any with thern, as these things are totally unneceffary; pro-
vided every one of them has at least five syllogisms, without which it is

impoffible to be wise:

ἠῢ Before them, lo, two golden talents lay;
Who wrangles best, shall bear the prize away.

Look what a heap of them there is, ihoving one another on, only at the
found of the two minae: some are got about the ἦ· Pelasgicon, some about
AEsculapius’s temple, some round the Areopagus, and some to ‡ Talus’s
sepulchre, others are planting ladders against the temple of the §Dioscuri,
and swarming up like bees, or so many clusters of grapes: to speak with

Homer,
ΙΙ Thick, as in spring, the flow’rs adorn the land,

Or leaves the trees

To Τω ἔμεν-ὃς μετα ’,ι-τισιν εἶιζεμει εξοχος ειη.
Qi reliquos rixa superaverit omnes.
