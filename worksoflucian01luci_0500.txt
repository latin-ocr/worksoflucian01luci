464 THEDISINHaeERITEDSON.

guilty of the greatest crimes against him, he should have called to mind the
benefit I had formerly conferred upon him, and looking back on past favourS,
have forgiven the present injury, especially when one is so much greater than
the other. This -is doubtless the ease with regard to him who must acknow-
lege it is owing to me that he liveS, thinks, and understands; and all this,
moreover, performed at a time when every body else had entirely given him
over, and owned that they were unequal to the cure of such a disorder.

At this time it may be added, I could not be considered as his son, nor
under any obligation to take the cure upon me ; 1 was an alien, a stranger,
and entirely free: yet did Ι -not neglect him, but ofmy own aceord, and un-
called for, flew to his affistance3 lraised, cured', and preserved him, by my
⁴diligence and attention, Ι appeased his anger, by my filial piety, Ι cancelled
the law against me, purchased my return, redeemed my honour, shewed
my attachment to him at the most dangerous crifis, by means of my art
adopted myself, as it were, into his family, and proved myself his true and
legitimate son. What did I not go through for him, what pains did I take
in administering the medicines to him, in watching the proper times and sea-
sons, sometimes giving way to the distemper, and at others, when it remit-
ted a little, throwing in the affistance of physic to oppose it! The care of such
men is the most dangerous part of our praefice: even the attendance on them
is extremely hazardous3 for in the height of their phrenzy‚ they frequently
vent the-ir rage on those who ⁴'are near them. Under all this, notwithstand-
ing, l never lost my patience, never was terrified or dismayed3 but struggled
by every poflible method against the disease, and at length, bythe2power of
medicine, overcame it.

It is very easy, perhaps, «you will say, -to give physic3 but much, let me
tell you, must be done before this; the way must be prepared for it, the
body must be rendered fit to receive ir, i-ts habit altered, by purging, by
sweadng, sometimes, where vit is necessary, by nourilhment, -by exercise, by
procuring rest and sseep. These things may be, perhaps, easily done in *
othe-r disorders, but madmen, from the wild state of their mind, are more
difficult to be led or governed; they are more dangerous, therefore, to the
physician, and scarce ever to be cured :sor it often happens, when we flatter
ourselves we are got to the end of this distemper, some little symptom oc-
curs, that overturns every thing we have done, gives it new strength, stops

urhe cure, and mocks the power of arr.
