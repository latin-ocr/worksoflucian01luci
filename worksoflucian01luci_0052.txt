delight as much as if they were real : thus dol, in the absence of my dear
philosophy, call to mind the words whichl heard, and joy in the recol·
leffion of them; toffed‚ asir were, on the ocean, in a da-rk and tempestuous
night, Ι look still towards this light, to guide and dire& me in every thing
Ι do or say3 imagine this great man present, and think Ι hear him
talking to me3 his face is ever before my eyes, and his voice still founding
in my ear3 for, as the ³¹⁵ comic poet says, he left a sting in the minds of his

hearers.

Pray, ‘my worthy friend, have done with your prolufions‚ and tell rne the
whole from beginning to end, for I am fick of your preambles.

You are certainly right, and it shall be so; but did you never see a bad
aetor hiffed off the stage, for spoiling a very excellent performance?

L U C I A N.

Aye, many a one; but what of that ?

F R I E N D.

Ι arn afraid I 111311 be like them, sometimes putting things together
aukwardly ·, and at others, by my own ignorance marring the sentiment itself,
till the whole piece by degrees becomes ridiculous. With regard to myself‚
indeed, I shall not be much concerned ; but if my dear philosophy should
appear mean and contemptible, from my bad representation of it, I own it
would affe& me deeply: Imust beg you, therefore, to remember throughout
the whole, that the poet is innocent, fits a great way off from the scene,
and never troubles himself about what is going forward on the stage. Ι will
try my talent, however, as an affitor, and shew you at least how good a memory
Ι have, though, with regard to every thing else, I may be little better than
a tragedy meffenger. If at any time, therefore, I seem to fail, you are to
suppose the thing itself much better, and that, when the poet made it, it
was quite another affair: if you should hiss me, Iaffure you, Ι shall not
be angry.

ἃ Comic pom] Alluding probably to that passage of Eupolis, quoted by Diodorus Siculus,
where, speaking of Pericles, the famous orator, he says, of all the great speakers

he could leave behind,
The sting, deep-pointed, in the hearer’s mind.
