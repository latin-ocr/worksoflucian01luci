shades, we should be suspected ourselves of wanting to make our escape
from it.

DIALOGUE XXIV.

MENIPPUS, AMPHILOCHUS‚ Auo TROPHONIUS.

MENIPPUS,

Ι Cannot imagine how you, Trophonius and AmphilochuS, now you
are dead, come to have temples erected to you, or why you are styled pro·
phets, and foolish mortals take you both for divinities.

T R O P H Ο Ν Ι U S.
Is it our fault, if they mistake dead rnen for gods?

MENIPPUS.

But they would never have taken you for such, if you had not, whilst you
were alive, boasted of your miracles, as if you could have looked into fu-

turity, and pretended to tell thern what was to happen hereafter.

TROPHONIUS.

Let Amphilochus answer for himself: as for me, I arn a hem, and al-
ways propheey when any body comes down to consult me. But, Ι suppose,

youhave never been at Libadia, or you would not have been so hard of be·
lies about these things.
M E N I P P U S.

What! because I have never been there, never carne cloathed in a linen
garment‚ and creeping through a narrow holeinto a cave, and standing, like
a fool‚ with a cake in my hand; for that, could not I discover that you are
as dead as we are, and all the difference lies in your being better able to de-
ceive: but now, by your art of prophesying‚ tell me, what is a hero? fot

Ι really do not know.
T R Ο P H O N Ι U S.

Something, between a man and a god.

MENIPPUS.

Which, you mean, is neither rnan nor god, but both together: pray,
where is that half of you, which belongs to the god, retired to at present?

TRO.
