DIALOGUESOF TnnGoDS. 107

Trojan Anchises 3 sometimes to Libanus, after that ἕ· Affyrian boy, whom
he has made in love with Proserpine, and so cheated me of half his affeetion:
I have often threatened him, if he do not leave off, to break his bow and
arrows, and clip his wings : but the other day I tiekled him with my ssip-
per for it: at first he is mighty fearful and suppliant, but very soon forgets
it. But, tell me, is this Endymion handsome? for that, you know, would

be some consolation.
L U N A,

To me, Iconfess, he appears charming, especially when, throwing his
garment on the roek, he goes to sseep, his arrows in his left hand, that seem
dropping from him, and his right supporting his head, and givi1g new
lustre to his beautiful face: his breath, as he sseeps, is sweeter than ambrosia :
then come Idown, as softly as poffible, and treading on my tip—toes, that I
may not wake and disturb him. You know the rest3 in ssuort, Ι am dying
for love of him.

DIALOGU'E XXXII.

MERCURY ΛΝΒ APOLLO.

M E R C U R Y.

marry two such pretty wives as Venus and ’ᾗ Aglaia?
A P O L L O.
It is strange good fortune, ind-tell, Mereury: but what I wonder at is,
that they will have any thing to say to him, when they see him sweating at
the forge, and his face all blaek with soot, and yet they ean kiss and em·

brace him.
M E R C U R Y.

This vexes me, and I cannot help envying him: you, Apollo, are proud
of your fine hair, your beauty, and your sszill on the harp: Ι, of my health,
strength, and lyre: and yet we must sseep alone.

⁸ Aſj'yrian boy,] Adonis. Diana’s boar sent him to hell, where Proserpine fell in love with
him: Venus intreated that he might return to earth, but the infernal goddess would not part
with him, and it was determined at last, to make both parties easy, that he should divide hia

time between them.
“ Aglaia,] The eldest of the three Graces ε the poets have married her to V ulean, probably,

because the works of that ingenious artist might be confidered as graceful, though his person> was
not so,

Pz APOLLO.
