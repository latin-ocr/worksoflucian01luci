Socrates, you are right: let us go in scari->h of Philosophy3 she shall be

thejudge, and we will abide by her determination.

L U C I Α Ν.
This, O wise and prudent men, is certainly the best and most legal me-

thod: keep your stanes, however, as I advised you, for you will want thern
soon ar the tribunal. But where shall we find Philosophy? for Ido not
know where she lives3 though 1 have been looking out for her h0u1e a long

time, in hopes of meeting with her there. In my way Ι lit on several men
with long beards, and cloaks, who said they had just come from her; ima-
gining, therefore, that they must know her place of abode, Ienquired of
them, but they, who knew no more than myself, either gave me no an-
swer, in order to conceal their ignorance, or dire&ed rne from one door to
another, so that to this day Icould never find the house. Many a time,

either led by my own fancy, or following some guide, I vifited certain places,
where Ι thought myself sure of catching her, attrad'ted thither by the multi—
tude of comers and goer‚s who all appeared with severe countenances,
grave habits, and looks, that carried with thern the appearance of deep
thought and meditation. With these I crouded myself in, unobserved, and
gained admiffion. There saw I a woman, who, though she seemed to have
dressed herself with a kind of studied neatness, had not the true air of fim-
plicity about her. Her hair, it was too vifible, which 1116 wished to appear
loosely flowing. she had taken care to adorn, nor was her robe put on with-
out 311εᾶ3ῖίοη : her whole dress was plainly an artful imitation of easy ne-
gligence, the paint and varnish, notwithstanding, appeared through all;
her discourse was loose, like that of a harlot; 1116 seemed happy when her
lovers praised her beauty‚ and, if they made her any present, accepted it
with greediness: would fit always near the rich, but took no notice of the
poor amongst thern. When 1116 was uncovered, l observed a gold necklace,
as thick as a dog-chain: when 1 saw this, 1 retired immediately, not with-

their own behalf ; and lest, by the length of their speeches, they should weary the judges’ pa-
tience, and hinder them from proceeding to other business, they were limited to a certain space
of time, which was measured by a κλεψυὶρα, or honr-glast, differing from ours-in this, that,
instead of saud, they made use of water. To prevent fraud, there was an officer appointed to
distribute the water equally to both fides; when the glass was run out, they were permitted to
speak no sarther Isother busmess intervened, the glass was stopped for the tirne; and if any
person had finished his speech, before all his water was run out, he might make over the re-
mainder to another.
