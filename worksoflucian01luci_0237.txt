TnnSPECTATORS. 201

after which they were to have placed Pelion upon offa, and so to make a
proper ladder and get up to heaven: the children, indeed, for they were
wicked rogues, suffe1ed for it ; but why should not we (for we have no de-
fign to do the gods any harm by it) build up something of the same kind,
by piling mountain upon mountain, till we get to a proper heignt for our
prospe& ?
C H A R Ο N.
And do you think, Mercury, that we two, by ourselveS, could lift up

Pelion or Ossa ?
M E R C U R Y.

Why not? Do you imagine we are not as able as those two boys ? We,

who are gods too ?
C H A R O N.

Certainly: and yet the thing appears to me so difficult, that it is almost

incredible.
M E R C U R Y.

Very poffibly: but you are a novice, Charon, in these affairs, and what is
worse, no poet: the noble ⁴* Homer put his mountains together so expedi-
tioussy, that, by the help of two verses only, he scaled heaven. I am sur-
prised you think this so miraculous, when you know how Atlas alone bears
up heaven, and carries us all upon his shoulders. You may have heard,
perhaps, τοο, of my brother HerculeS, how he got under, in the room of
Atlas, and cased him of his burthen for a little time.

C H A R Ο N.

All this I have heard, most certainly z but you and the poets can best tell

whether it be true or no.
M E R C U R Y.
All true, Charon, you may depend on it ; how could such wise men ever

tell lies? First, therefore, as Homer the architect, and his verses direct
us, let us root up Offa, then -.

On Offa, Pelion nods, with all his wood.

Do not you observe how eafily and poetically this is done? Get up here,

then, and see if this will do, or whether we must pile up some more: ex-
cellent, indeed! we are got to the botrom of heaven already, for 1 can just
see Ionia and Lydia from the east, Italy and Sicily from the west, from the
north only those parts that are near the Danube, and a very little of Crete
