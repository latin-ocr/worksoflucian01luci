THE TYRANT-KILLER. 45¹

These thingS, however, did not terrify me, the difficulty of the task did
not prevail on me to lay it afide, nor did the fight of danger alarm me with
fear: Ι alone attacked this complex tyranny, I alone with my good sword,
,ssew the tyrant; with death before my eyes, Ι determined with my own life
to redeem the public freedom. When I came to the first strong tower, after
ssaying all the guards I met, and pufhing through every obstacle, I made
my way to the source of all our calamities, beheld the tyrant refisting with
all his might, but, with many wounds, I at length overcame‚ and ssew him.

My undertaking succeeded, and the tyranny was now at an end; from
that moment we all were free: the old man alone remained, unguarded,
and unarmed3 his great defendet now cut off, he was totally deserted‚ and
was no longer worthy of a brave and powerful adversary. Thus, therefore,
Ojudges, 1 said to myself‚ “ Every thing is now well, every thing is done,
all is happily finished3 how is he to be punished who still survives? he is
unworthy of me, and of this hand ; it shall not, after so great and noble a deed‚
be disgraced: some more vulgar one shall be employed: nor shall he profit
by this calamity : no, let him behold, and let him suffer3 let the sword lie
by him3 to that Ι commit the rest.'’ 1 determined on this, and left him :
he acted as Ι thought he would, the tyrant ssew himself, and thus crowned
the deed.

Ι come, therefore, to you, with good ¹tidings ofjoy and freedom, bidding
you all to be of good cheer with me, who have established for you a demo-
cracy. Ye see the fruit of my labours, the city is freed from its wicked
rulers; none tyrannises now amongst you ; you may now bestow honours on
whom you please, renew the course ofjustice, and dispute openly according
to the laws. All this is the work of my hands, the effe& of my bravery, all
owing to that death which the father could not survive; for this I now solicit
the reward that is due to me ι not, that from mean and sordid avarice, not,
that from the hopes of gain, 1 meant to serve my country3 but that by your
bounties, you may confirm the merit of my adfinns, nor detra& from the ho-
nour of it, by with-holding that reward which it hath so amply deserved.

My adversary still denies that Ι have any right to ask this of you, that I
am not the tyram-killer. That l have not acted according to the law, and
that something is still wanting to intitle me to the reward : but thus would I
interrogate him ε What more do you require of me? was I not willing ἓ did
1 not go up? did 1 not ssay him? did 1 not set you free? who now reigns?
