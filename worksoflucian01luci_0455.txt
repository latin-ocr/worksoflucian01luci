from the stars over Cappadocia, were to be there, together with five thousand
ἕξ Hippogerani3 these Ι did not see, for they never carne: I shall not ar-
¹tempt, therefore, to describe them3 of these, however, most wonderful
things were related.

Such were the forces of Endymion; their arms were all alike3 their· hel-
mets were made of beans, for they have beans there of a prodigious fize and
strength ; and their scaly breast-plates of lupines sowed together, for the
skins of their lupines are like a horn, and impenetrable; their shields, and
swords, the same as our own.

The army ranged themselves in this manner: the right wing was formed
'by the Hippogypi, with the king, and round him his chosen band to prote&
him, amongst which, we were admitted3 on the left, were the Lachanopteri;
the auxiliaries in the middle3 the foot were in all about fixty thousand myri-
ads. They have spiders, you must know, in this country, in infinite nurn-
bers, and of pretty large dimenfions, each of them being as big as one of the
iss'ands of the Cyclades3 these were ordered to cover the air from the Moon
quite to the Morning-star : this being immediately done, and the field of bat·
tle prepared, the infantry was drawn up under the command of Nyeterion‚

*the son of Eudianax.
The left wing of the enemy, which was commanded by Phaeton himself,

aconfisted of the Hippomyrrnices: these are large birds, and resemble our
ants, except, with regard to fize, the largest of them covering two acres:
these sight with their horns, and were in number about fifty thousand. ln

· *the right wing were the-§- Acroconopes, about five thousand, all archers,

and riding upon large gnats. To these succeeded the 1 Acrocoraces, light in-
fantry, but remarkably brave, and useful warriors, for they threw out of
ssings excecding large radishes, which whoever was struck by, died imme—
diately, a most horrid'stench exhaling from the wound3 they are said, in-
deed, to dip their· arrows in a poisonous kind of mallow. Behind these,

estood ten thousand ᾗ Caulornycetes‚ heavy·armed soldiers, who fight hand
sto hand3 so called, because they use ssrields made of mushrooms, and spears
