But who is that, Mercury, with the diadem and purple robe? *ἓ the cook
is presenting him with a gold ring that he found in a fish's belly.

Well applied, Charon : that is Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, who thinks
himself completely happy3 but he shall fall in a moment from the summit
of felicity, be betrayed by his servant Maeandrius, given up to Oraetes the
satrap, and hanged on a gibbet 2 for this also did Ι learn from Clotho.

C H A R O N.

Excellent Clotho! go on, most noble Cloth03 hang some, behead others,
that they may know themselves to be but men ε raise them to the utmost
height, that their fall may be the greater, and their punishment the more
severe. Ishall laugh hereafter, when 1 see them in my boat, stripped of

That you most certainly will. But do not you observe a large multitude

yonder, some fighting, others sailing, some going to law, others to plough,

ful in every thing he undertook, was advised by Amasis, king of Egypt, by way of sacrifice to
fortune, to part with something which he held most valuable‚ he, accordingly, took a ring
from his finger, ofimmense value, and threw it into the sea; when lo, to his great astonish-
ment, but a few days after, the very same ring came again to his hands, his cook finding itin
the belly of a fifh, which had been presented to the tyram, and which he immediately carried to
him. The story adds, that Amasis, hearing os the event, foretold that Polycrates should die a
violent death. Imagining. we are to suppose, that such extraordinary good fortune must, some

day or other, be followed by an eqnal calamity.
† Sea-girt ista] Charon quotes part of one verse in Homer, and part of another, making up

one whole hexameter.
