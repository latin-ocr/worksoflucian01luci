MERCURY.

That is false3 for 1 could mention several who had not a sarthing over
night to buy a halter with, and next day lived in riches and splendor3
were drawn in their chariots by white horses, though a little before they
were not worth ajack-ass ε some I have seen clothed in purple, and rolling

fernal deity, for their riches.
