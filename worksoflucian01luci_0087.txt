TIMON. 51

est of all flatterers‚ and famous for oaths, insolence, and imposture: on
the whole a most perfect charaetem we shall see presently, with all his mo-
desty, what a bawling he will make. Ha! how is this? Thrasycles here

at last ?

I come not hither, Timon, as others do, with the hopes of sharing your
riches, or partaking of your feasts; to fawn upon, and fiatter an honest and
generous man, as Ι know you are ε you very well know, a little pulse satisfies
me, that the best supper Ι desire is an onion and a few cresses, or, when 1
choose to indulge, a little salt for luxury; my drink, water from the public
fountain. This old tattered cloak to me is better than a purple robe, and,
as to gold, Ivalue it no more than the sand on the sea-shore. I came hither
only to serve you3 to prevent, if possible, your being corrupted by that worst
and most dangerous of all human poffeffions, money, which has been the
fatal cause of so much misery to thousands. If you will take my advice, 1
would have you throw all your riches into the sea, as things unneceffary to
an honest man, and one who knows the treasures of philosophy; not that Ι
would have you cast them into the main ocean, but rather walk in up to your
middle, and throw them a little beyond the shore, where no body could see
you but myself3 or, if you do not choose this, you may go another way to
work, throw your gold immediately out of the window, give one five drach-
mas, another a mina, another a talent, and not leave yourself a single far-
thing. If there should chance to be a philosopher in your way, it is proper
you should give him twice or thrice as much as the rest; for my own part,
not that I mind it myself, but that Imay give it away to some of my poor
friends, I shall be satisfied if you will only fill this little pouch, which holds
scarce two bushels : philosophers should be content with a little, and wish for

nothing beyond their scrip.

Ι entirely approve of what you say3 before 1 fill your bag therefore I shall
give you a few thumps on the head, and my spade shall make up the rest

toyou.
THRASYCLES.

Now, laws and commonwealth assist me! Here am Ibeaten and bruised in
a freevcity by a villain.
