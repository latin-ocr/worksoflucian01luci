WRITINGHISTORY5 409

Whilst they are embatteled, his eye is not fixed on any particular part, nor
on any one leader, unless, perhaps, a ³⁸* Brafidas steps forth to scale the wa115‚
or a Demosthenes to prevent him. To the generals he gives his first atten-
tion, listens to their commandS, their counsels, and their determination;
and, when they come to the engagement, he weighs in equal scale the ac-
tions of both, and closely attends the pursuer and the pursued, the conqueror
and the conquered. All this must be done with temper and moderatim, so
as not to satiate or tire, not inartificially, not childishly, but with ease and
grace. When these things are properly taken care of, he may turn afide to
others, ever ready and prepared for the present event, † keeping rime, as
it were, with every circumstance and event : fiying from Armenia to Media,
and from thence with clattering wings to Italy, or to Iberia, that not a mo·
ment may escape him.

The mind ofthe historian should resemble a looking-glasS, shining, clear,
and exaCHy true, representing every thing as it really is, and nothing distort-
ed, or ofa different form, or colour. He writes not to the masters of elo·
quenee, but fimply relates what is done: it is not his to consider what he
shall say, but only how it is to be said. He may be compared to Phidias,
Praxiteles, Alcamenus, or other eminent artists ; for neither did they make
the gold, the filver, the ivory, or any of the materials which they worked
upon ,ς these were supplied by the Elians‚ the Athenians, and Argives3 their
only business was to cut and polish the ivory, to spread the gold into various
forms, ari} join them together3 their art was properly to dispose what was
put into their hands : and such is the work of the historians, to dispose and
adorn the aetions of men, and to make them known with clearness‚ and pre·
cifion. To represent what he hath heard, as if he had been himself an eye-
witness of it. To perform this well, and gain the praise resulting from it,
is the business of our historica] Phidias.

When every thing is thus prepared, he may begin if he pleases without
preface or exordium, unless the subje& particularly demands it; he may
supply the place of one, by informing us what he intends to write upon, in
the beginning of the work itself: if, however, he makes use of any preface,

Ἃ· Brastdas.] The famous Lacedaemonian general. The circumstance alluded t0, is in Thu-
cydides. Β. iv.

† Keeping time.] Gr. ομοκρωειτο, a technical term, borrowed from mufic, vand fignifying that
tone of the voice which exaffly corresponds with the instrument accompanying it.
