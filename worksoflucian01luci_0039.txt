THEDREAM. 3

at her brother for his cru'el treatment ε 1 went to bed in great affliffion, full
of gloomy thoughts, and at last fell asseep. What I have already told you
‚is childish and ridiculous‚ but 1 111311 now acquaint you with something
more worthy of your attention; for, ro speak in the language of Homer,

’ἃ As 1 ssumber’d in the shades of night,
A dream divine appear’d before my light,

 

so clear and plain, as to have all the appearance of truth. Even at this
distance of time, what I saw is actually before my eyes; and every thing I
heard, still sounding in my ears3 so powerful was the effe& it had upon me.
Two women, methought, laid violent hands on me, each dragging me with
all her force towards them, as if they would tear me in pieces; they strug-
gled hard 3 one of them got the better, and held me fast for a little time,
and then the other. They both made a great noise, one crying out that
1116 would have her own; the other, that 1116 had no right to that which
belonged to her only. One of thern had a masculine air, like some work-
ing person, with hard hands, and dirty hair, covered with dust, as my
uncle used to be when he was polishing marble; the other had a beautiful
face, a modest appearance, and was dreffed in a neat and becoming garb-
At length they agreed ro submit the affair to my decifion, and the first of
them thus addreffed me3 ‘⁶ Know, my dear child, that I am Sculpture‚ that
art which you yesterday began to learn, no stranger to yourself, and well
known to your family3 your grandfather (and named his name) was a sta-
tuary, and so were both your uncles also, whom I rendered illustrious; if
therefore you will leave that idle trade which 1116 (pointing to the other)
would fain teach you, to follow and live with me; by being brought¹ up
to toil and labour you will grow strong and robust, and will live free from
the attacks of malice and envy: you need not leave your country and your
friends to go into foreign parts, nor shall you gain a reputation by mere
words alone. Despise not my external appearance, or this mean and sordid
ᾗ habit3 thus was the great ἦ Phidias clad, so famous for his statue of Jove,
and Polycletus, no less celebrated for his Juno3 Myro and Praxiteles are

ἢ* 866 Homer’s Iliad, book ii. ver. 71, Pope's transsation.

† Phidias, tera] The statue of Jupiter Olympius, by Phidias, is celebrated by almost all
the best Greek writers as the chef-d’oeuvre of antiquity3 great encomiums are likewise bestowed
on Polycletus’s Juuo, the famous cow by Myr0‚ and the Venus of Praxiteles.
