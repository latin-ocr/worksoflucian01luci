333 ZEUXIS.

these, he advised him carefully to conceal behind the ranks, so as not to be
seen by the enemy 3 when the trumpets founded, and the battle began, their

horse advaneed, the chariots ofthe Gallo-Greeians opened to give them way,
when four of the elephants rushed out against one party, and four against
another, eight more opposed the charior-drivers ι this, they thought would
frighten the horses, and make the enemy fall upon, and destroy one another:
and so it happened3 for neither the Gallo-Grecians themselves, nor their
horscs‚ having ever seen an elephant, they were terrified at a fight so unsus-
pected, and even before the monsters approached, as soon as they heard thern
bellow at a distance, and saw their trunks and teeth shining under their black
hides, as is they would tear every thing to picces, they fied away, before a
dart was thrown, in the utmost confusion : the foer, in the mean time, ssain
by each other, and trod upon by the cavalry, who rushed npon them with
all their force, and the chariots driving back upon their own men, which

caused great ssaughter amongst them 3 f as ’δὲ Homer says,
In heaps on heaps, the foe tumultuous flios·

The horses, thu5‚ once broke, and put out of their way, were routcd by
the elephants, threw down their drivers, and left the cars rolling on, and
mowing down numbers with their scythes; the elephants treading upon thern,
and with their trunks rossing their bodies into the air, and tearing them in
pieces; insomuch, that Antiochus, by their means, at length gained a com-
plete viGtory. Most of the enemy were either ssain or taken prisoners‚ ex-
cept a few, who saved themselves by flight. The Macedonians sung a pean,
erowned Antiochus, and exulted on the vidtory: but he, with tears in his
eyes, cried out, “Should we not rather blush, my fellow-soldiers, to think
our success was all owing to these sixteen beasts3 if the enemy had not been
sime& with the novelty os the fight, what would have become of us ?’' He
emntnanded, therefore, that nothing but an elephant should be inscribed on
the trophy. ,

ἶ arn much afraid, lest something like Antiochus’s battle should happen to
myselt} it is perhaps, my elephants alone, that frighten, and cause so much
admiration ; it is the novelty of a female Centaur‚ which appears so new and
wonderful 3 and all the rest of Zeuxis’s performance was but labour in vain.
Ι will not think so, for you understand painting well, and are exquifitejudges
of the art : I hope my produfitions will be worthy of your approbation-
