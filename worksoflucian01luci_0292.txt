out pitying those miserable wretches, who suffered themselves thus to be
led by her, not by the nose, but by the heard, and, like Ixion, embraced a

cloud for a Juno.

So far you are right3 for the door is not eafily found, nor open to every
one: neither, indeed, is there any neceffity of going to her house, for we
shall meet her here in the Ceramicus, on her return from the Academy‚
when 1116 comes to wall< in the portico, as 1116 usually does every day ι and
behold! here 1116 is: observe her decent habit, the mildness of her aspe&‚
how ssow 1116 walks along, and seems wrapped in thought.

never called her to account, or reproved her for it; 1116 is at liberty to sport,
it suits a festiva13 and wellI know, that nothing truly good and valuable
is ever the worse for the ridicule thrown upon it, but comes out, like gold
from the hammer, only more bright and splendid. You are angry and pro-

voked, ye know not why. What makes you pull him so tight? you will
strangle him.

ἃ· Fcast ofBacchus.] Alluding to the Comedy of the Clouds, by Aristophanes, represented

during the solemnity ofthat festival, when Philosophy suffered so much in the person of So-
crates, from the indecent raillery of that celebrated poet.
