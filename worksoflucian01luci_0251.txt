THESPECTATORs. 2¹5

point out where {he once stood. Yonder is Babylon, surrounded by an ex-
tenfi've wall, and defended by many towers; in a few years, ihe, like ⁴* Nine-
veh, ' will be no more, and yon may search for her in vain. As for Mycene,
and Cleone, 1 am afhamed to lhew them to you, and, above all poor Troy :
for Iknow, when you return, you will throttle the poor bard for his magni·
ficent encomiums: these were all in their time fleurissring and happy, but
they are gone3 cities, lixke men, must perilh: and, what is more astonish-
ing, whole rivers alsO, insomuch that not the least remains of Inachus are

now to be found in Argos.
C H A R Ο Ν.

What, Homer, then avail thy pompous titles of sacred Troy, so famed
for her broad streets,

Well built Cleone‚ ὅτε.

But see, whilst we are talking, who are those yonder, that fight so, what is
the cause of their quarrel?

M E R C U R Y.
Those, Charon, are the Argives and Lacedaemonians, with their dying
general ᾖ Othryades, ereffing a trophy, and writing his own name upon it

in his own blood.
C H A R Ο N.

What is the cause of the war?

M E R C U R Y.
The very field on which they fight.

C H A R O N.

O the folly of these mortals, who are so ignorant as not to see, that ifevery
one of them were now masters of all Peloponnesus, a little spot of scaree a
foot long, must be all they shall receive from AEacus hereafter3 another and
another owner shall till this field, and with their ploughs tear up the trophy
from its foundation.

’ᾗ Nineveh] Swi ft seems to have had this paffirge in his eye, when he wrote the following,

If neither brass nor marble can withstand,

. The mortal force of Time’s destrufflve hand ;
If mountains fink to vales, if cities die,
And less'ning rivers mourn their fountains dry3
When my old caffoc (said a Welch diVIne),
Is out at elbows, why sslou’d I repine ?

ἧ- Othryades] See Ovid's Fast. book ii. l. 665.
