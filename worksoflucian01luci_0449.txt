THE

TRUEHISTORY‚

BOOK 1.

Luc1AN's True History is, as 'the Author himself acknowleges in the Preface to it,
a Collettion of ingenious Lies, calculated principally to amuse the Reader, not with-
out several Allustons‚ as he informs us, to the Works of ancient Poets, Historiam,
and Philofhphers, as well as, most probably, the Perfhrmances of contemporary
Writers, ‘whofh Absurdities are either obliquely glanced at, or openly ridiculed and
expofi’d. We cannot but lament that the Humour of the greatest Part os these
Allustons must be lost to us, the works themselves being long since buried in Obli-
vion. Luemn's True History, therefore, like the Duke of Buckingharn's
Rehearsal‚ cannot be half fh agreeable us when it wasfiist written 3 there is, how-
ever, enough remaining to secure it from contempt. Yhe Vein osrich Fancy, and
Wldness of a luxuriant Imagination, which run through the whole, figffi'ciently
point out the Author as a Man of uneommon Genius and Invention. §The Reader

will eafily perceive that Bergerac, Swift, and other W'iters have read this PVork
of LuctAn’S, and are much indebted to him fhr it.

S athletics of all kinds hold it necessary, not only to prepare the body
A by exercise and discipline, but sometimes to give it proper relaxation‚
which they esteem no less requifite, so do Ι think it highly neccffary also for
men of letters, after their severer studies, to relax a little, that they rnay return
to thern with the greater pleasure and alacrity3 and for this purpose there is
no better repose than that which arises from the reading of such books as
not only, by their humour and pleasantry‚ may entertain them, but convey
at the same time some useful instruition, both which, I flatter myself, the

reader will meet with in the following history ; for he will not only be pleased
with the novelty of the plan, and the variety of lies, which Ι have told with
an air of truth, but with the tacit allufions so frequently made, not, 1 trust,

without some degree of humour, to our ancient poets‚ historians, and phi-
losophers, who have told us some rnost miraculous and incredible stodes,

and which Ι should have pointed out to you, but that l thought they would

be sufficiently vifible on the perusal.
Ctefias,
