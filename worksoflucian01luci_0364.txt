O heaven! HermotimuS, what poor creatores you make of uls, worse than
pigmies, we crawl only on the surface of the earth; and no wonder,= indeed,

probable that you should go through so much labour, and torment yourself
night and day, when you did not know but, perhaps, as soon as you had

got near the top, fate on a sudden should seivze on, and at once deprive you

day, to be happy 'm the enjoyment of true wisdom !
