Β Ι D D E R.
Most wonderful doctrineS, indeed, and amazingly useful! 1 willgive

you twenty for him.
M E R C U R Y.

Very well. Who have we left? O, this Sceptic‚ you ἐς Pyrrhian there,
stand forth, that you may be sold immediately: numbers are going away, Ι
see, and the sale must be amongst a very few. Now, gentlemen, who buys

him?
BIDDER.

I will : but first tell me, you, what do you know ?

÷PH1LosoPHER.

Nothing. B Ι D D E R

What do you mean?
PHILOSOPHER.
That nothing appears to me to be certain.
Β 1 D D E R.
And are we nothing ourselves ?
PHILOSOPHER.

That 1 am not certain of.
B Ι D D E R.

And do you know yourself to be nothing ?

PHILOSOPHER.
Thac Ι arn still more in doubt about.

Β Ι D D E R.
Strange perplexity! but what are those scales for?

PHILOSOPHER.
In them I weigh the reasons on each fide, and when Ifind the balance

equal on both, conclude that I know nothing.

Β Ι D D E R.
And can you do any thing else well?

ἢ* Pyrrhia] Meaning Pyrrho, the famous sceptic; as he is putting up to sale, he calls him
Pyrrhia, the name of a ssave.

ἦ· Ρόί]ο[ορ1]ον.] As nothing remains in the original but the i'nitial letters ΦῑΛ. the commen-
tatore are in doubt whether Lucian meant the contra&ion Phil. for philosopher, or the famous
sceptic Philo· Ι have preferred the former, because Pyrrho, the founder, had been mention-
ed befwe, and Lucian did not mean to change the person, but only to call him by the general
name of philosopher ; it is a matter, however, of no great consequence which name we call
hini by.
