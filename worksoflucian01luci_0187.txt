they are: why should you gape after other people's estates, and fawn upon
old men who have no children? For this reason you are defervedly laughed
at, when, instead of your burying THeM, they bury Y0U3 and, as you wilh
for THEIR deaths, all the world is glad of Youns: Y¹ou invented this new
art, this falling in love with old men and women, who have no children ; for
those who have children are never courted by you : some of them, indeed,
whom you have neglected, seeing your defign, though they had children,
pretended to hate them, that they might draw you in to flat'ter them, and,
after all the presents you had made them, cut you off in their wills: thus
nature prevailed, as she ought, their own children ‘possessed the inheri-
tance‚ and you gnashed your teeth with grief at the disappointment.

It is too true: what a deal of money have Ι lost by that Thucrivue, who,

whenever 1 came in, pretended to be dying, fetched a deep figh, and
squeaked like a chicken in the egg-ss1e113 and Ι, like a fool, thinking he was

just ready to be put into his coffin‚ sent him present on present, for sear my
rivals should excel me in generofity : laid awake whole nights, counting my
riches and dispofing of them ε the want of sseep, and uneafiness I underwent
were, indeed, the cause of my death, and the old fellow, when he had
sucked all he could out of me, the day before yesterday, when Ι was buried,
stood over my grave and laughed at me.

Well done, Thucritus : long mayest thou live, abounding in wealth,
and laughing at such fools as these ; nor mayest thou die, till thou hast
sent all thy flatterers before thee !

O Pluto, if Chariades dies beItioreiDThutiritus, I shall be happy.

P L U T O.
Be of good cheer, Terpfion; for Phido, and Melanthus, and all of them

will die before him, and of the same distemper as yourself.
