306 ONDEPENDANTS.

so happy, you are still, however, agreeably deceived, and imagine that
things will go better for the future : but the dire& contrary of what you ex-
pee'ted comes to pass; it is ³* Mandrabulus’ bufiness‚ as the old adage says,
it grows less and less every day, and all goes backwards.

At length, by degrees, through a kind of glimmering light, you begin to
perceive that all your golden hopes were nothing but water-bubbles, and
your labours and miseries but too real, inevitable, and perpetual. And what,
you will say, are they? Ι see nothing in all this so miserable or laborious.
I will tell you, my friend, what there is; attend to me, and you shall hear,
not only what there is in it so laboriouS, but how base also, mean, and ser-
vile is the employment.

And first, remember, that from this time you are no longer free or noble,
Your liberty, your name, and family, were all left behind, the moment
you entered those doors as a voluntary ssave. On such mean and degrading·
business freedom would never deign to accompany you. ,y A ssave however
you detest that name, you are, and must be; not of one, but of many, and

must bend your neck to the yoke from morning to evening for paltry wages.
And as you were not brought up to ssavery, but learned the habit late in life,
and voluntarily offered yourself when at years of maturity, you will be no
great favourite of your master’s, nor held in any degree of estimation by
him; for the remembrance of former freedom spoils you sor a ssave, and ren-
ders you incapable of performing, as you ought, the offices of one. A ssave,
however, you certainly are, though‘ not the son of *ἦ Pyrrhias or Zopyrion ;
nor sold, like Bithynians, by public: austion: for if, when the day of pay-
ment comes, you hold out your hand, like other servantS, and take what
you can get, you are to all intents and purposes a hired ssave: there wants no
crier to put up to sale the man who sells himself, and wh0, for a long time,
has been in search of a master.

Mean wretch ! (for so 1 must call the man who· pretends to be a philoso-

pher>3 if a pirate had sold thee, thou would'st have lamented thy lost free-

* lllamlrabulzcs.] This was a kind of proverbial expreflion, usually applied to persons or
things growing by <¹:2grees worse and worse, and is said to have derived its original from one
Mandrabulus of Semne, who, having found a considerable treasure‚ thought it his duty to of-
fer up an annual sacrifice to Juno. The first year, it seems, he gave her a golden sheep, the
second only a silver, and the third a brass one. The proverb, we see on the explanation of it,
was happily applied.
