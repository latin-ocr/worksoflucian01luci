History may sometimes affume a poetical form, and rise into a magnifi-
cence of expreffion, when the subject demands it3 and especially when it is
describing armies, battles, and sea-fights. The* Pierian spirit is wanting
then to swell the sails with a propitians breeze, and carry the lofty ship over
the tops of the waves. ln general, the diction should creep humbly on the
ground, and only be raised as the grand and beautiful occurring shall require
it; keeping, in the mean time, within proper bounds, and never soaring into
enthufiasm3 for then it is in danger of ranging beyond its limits, into poetic
fury: we must then pull in the rein, and a& with cau'tion, well knowing that'
it is the worst vice of a writer, as well as of a horse, to be wauton and un-
rnanageable. The best way therefore is, whilst the mind of the historian is
on horseback, for his style to wall< on foot, and take hold of the rein, that
it may not be left behind. ’

With regard to composition„ the words should not be so blended and trans-
posed as to appear harsh and uncouth3 nor should you, as some do, subje&
them entirely -to the ἦ» rhythmus ; one is always faulty, and the other dis--
agreeable -to the reader.

Fae'ts must not be carelessly put together, but with grear lto-2'}-s›<s,=1.;:. r and atten-
tion; if poffible, let the historian be an eye-witness of e arv :r mg nt means to
record : or, if that cannot be, rely on those only who are uncorruptt, and who
have no biass from paffion or prejudice, to add or to diminish any thing.
And here much sagacity will be requifite ro find out the real truth. When
he has collected all, or most of his materials, he will first make a kind of
diury, a body whose members are not yet distinct3 he will then bring it into
order and beautify it, add the colouring of style and language, adopt his
expreflion to the subjeEt, and harmonize the several parts of it; then, like
Homer's j Jupiter, who casts his eye sometimes on the Thracian, and some-
times ou the Mysian forces 3 he beholds now the Roman, and now the Per-
fian armies, now both, if they are engaged, and relates what pafles in them.

ἦ Pierianspi7·it.] Howjust is this observation of Lucian's, and at the same time how truly
poetical is the image which he makes use ofto express it 1 lt puts us in mind of his rival critic
Longinus, who, as Pope has obierved‚-— is himself the great sublime he draws.'

† The Rythmus] By this very just observation, Lucian means to censure all those writers,
and we have many such now amongst us„ who take so much pains to smooth and round theirpe-
riods‚ as to disgust their readers by the frequent repetition of it, as it naturally produces a tire-
some sameness in the found of them ,- and at the same time discovers too much that laborious
art and care, which it is always the author’s bufiness, as much as poffible, to conceal.
