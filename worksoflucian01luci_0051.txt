valuable in the eyes of the multitude, and which once indeed attracted my
esteem also. Iwas so struck with every thing he said, that Ι knew not what
to compare my feelings to on the occafion3 but was transported as it were a
thousand ways. Igrieved, methought, to see the things which Ι had so
long held dear contemned, and could scarce refrain from tears at the loss of
them : but ιπονν, those very riches, glories, and honours, which Ι so
esteemed, appear trifling and ridiculous; Ι rejoiced to find myself freed
