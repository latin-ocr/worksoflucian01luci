3ἃοι· represents Jupiter, Neptune, or Minerva, and does not perform
his part suitable to the dignity ofthe character, those who preside over the
sacred festivals frequently chastise thern for it, nor are the gods angry with
the executioners for punishing those who thus niisrepresent them, but rather
favour and applaud their defenders : for to a& vilely the part of a servant or
meffenger, is a small fault ; but to give the spestators a false idea ofa Jov'e,
or a Hercules, is most lhameful and abominabie.

The most absurd thing of all is, that most of these rnen, who so diligent-
ly applj,⁷ themselves to the study of your dossrines, live, at the farne time,
as if they only read and admired, with the defign of affiting direffly con-
trary to them. When they tell us, for instance, that they despise glory
and richeS, that nothing can be good that is not honest, that we should
never be angry‚ that we ssiould hold the great in contempt, and treat them
as our equals, all this is right, and wise, and worthy of admiration3 and
yet the very men who teach these things, are paid for it, are perpetually
gaping after wealth‚ and paying their court to the rich ; more curst than lap·
dogs, more timid than hares: affes are not so lewd, cats so rapacious, or
game-cocks so quarrelsome. How trul)r ridiculous it is to see thern hunting
one another frorn great rnen’s door53 present at every good supper, and find-
ing fault with every thing at it, and philosophifing in their cups, and saying
the most foolish and disagreeable things, when the wine is roo much for
thern ι whilst the guests laugh, and are heartily fiel< ofsuch philosophy.

But the worst of all is, to hear them crying out that they want nothing3
that the wise man alone is truly rich : and, a little after, aiking for money,
and being highly offended if you do not give it them : just as is a man with
a tiara, a diadem, and all the enfigns of royalty about him, should go a
begging. XVhen they receive any thing themselves, you are sure to have an
oration about the equa] partition of every good, and the vanity of riches :
for what, say they, are gold and filver, are they not like the sand on the
sea shore ? Eut if an old friend or acquaintance comes to ask them for any
thing, thenit is all poverty, silence, or denial, and every thing they had
said is retra&ed ε 311 their fine speeches about friendihip and virtue are gone,
we know not where, like so many birds, all fied3 as if words were only
meant to fight stram hames with, in their schoors and public meetingss As
long as there is no gold or filver before thern, they are very good friends;

but ssiew them a single farthing, and the peace is broken immediate1y3 there
