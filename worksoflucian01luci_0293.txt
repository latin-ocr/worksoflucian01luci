TnzFISHERMAN. ²5⁷

P L A Ο.
We have got leave for a day, and camsse up on purpose to insti& on him

the punishment which he deserves, as soon as we heard what he had published

againstus.
P HI Lo S Ο P HY.

And would you put him to death unheard, and before any trial? He
seems as if he wanted to say something in his own defence.
P L A T Ο.
No: we have referred every thing to you; your opinion must decide the
controversy.

What sayyou ,θ

PHILOSOPHY.

L U C Ι A N.
To you, my divine mistress, Ι submit, for you alone can discover truth;
but, with much intreaty‚ scarce could Iprevail on them to refer the cause to

your determination.
P L A T O.

Now, rascal, you can call her your mistress: but a little while ag0, in
a full affembly, you pronounced her most contemptible‚ and would sell all
her doctrines for two pence.

P H Ι L O S 0 Ρ Η Y.
But, suppose he meant only to expose, not Philosophy, but some im·

postors, who committed bad actions in my name.

L U C I A Ν.
That you shall soon be affured of, if you will attend to what I shall say in
my defence: but let us step afide a little to the '⁴‘ Areopagus, or rather to
the Acropol=s itself, whence, as from a watch-tower‚ we may see every

thing about the city. p H Ι L 0 S 0 P H Y

You, my friend5‚ in the mean time, may wall< about the † Portico; Ι
will come to you again, as soon as this affair is determined.

L U C Ι A N.
Who are these ? by their mein and deportment they seem to be most truly

resped‘table.

⁸ Areopagus.] The great Athenian court of judicature, called the Areopagus‚ or Mars’s Hm,
as sablee tell us, from the arraignment of Mars, who was the first criminal tried in it.

† Portica] The Ποικιλη, or Poecile, so called from the VARIETY it contained of curious pic-
tures‚ done by the greatest masters, was the famous Portico where Zeno taught philosophy, and
instituted the Stoic sen, so called from foa, stoa, another name for this portico.
