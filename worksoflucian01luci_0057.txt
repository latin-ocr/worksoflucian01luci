NIGRINUS. 2,

stretching out their fingers that you may see the rings upon them, and prae-
tifing a thousand follies: but what is still more ridiculous, if they meet,
they will speak to you only by proxy, as thinking it honour sufficient if they
permit you but to look at them 3 some are so proud as even to expe& adora-
tion, not at a distance, or after the Persian mode, but coming close up,
with your eyes fixed on the ground, aud ssrewing the submiffion of your soul
by the humble posture of your body, kiffing the breast or hand: and
even this is looked upon as a high and mighty favour, by those who are not
so happy as to arrive at it: and thus the idol shall stand for a long time,
and suffer himself to be made a fool of. At the same time, I must own, we
are obliged to the cruel creatures for refusing us the honour of their lips.
Those, after all, are more to be despised, who run after and cringe to them,
who will rise up in the middle of the night, and run about the city3 a set
of fawningcurs‚ whom the very servants turn out of doors, who will yet
press in to flatter them; the reward of all their trouble is only a supper,
that is a burthen to them, and brings on a thousand ill consequences; for
after eating and drinking more than they like, and saying perhaps more
than they ought to say, they return home fiel< and sorry, find fault with the
supper, the company, the house, and the master of it; some are found
fiel< in the lanes and alleys, others quarrelling in the stews, whilst three
parts of them lie in bed till noon, and give the phyficians an opportunity of
taking their rounds to visit them3 though some, indeed, which you will
say is most ridiculous of all, cannot even find leisure to be fick. The flat-

terers are, in my opinion, worse than those they fiatter, as they are generally
the supporters of their pride and insolence3 when such men throng to their
levees, admire their siches, and, when they meet, salute them as their lords
and masters, what must they think ? Whereas, on the other hand, if they
would agree to shake off this voluntary servitude, s* would not the rich,
think you, come themselves to the doors of the poor, and beg them not to
let their happiness pass unnoticed? the magnificenee of their houses, and
the sumptuousness of their rables, useless and unobserved? for it is not their
riches that gives them so much pleasure, as the satisfae’tion ofbeing thought

happy in the pofl'effion of thern. Fine palaees, gold, and ivory, are of no

ἃ Would not the rich, &c.] This is a most senfible and judicious observation, founded on
truth and reason. Nigrinus abounds, indeed. throughout with refleftions of this kind,

equally applicable at all times, and in all places. s .
