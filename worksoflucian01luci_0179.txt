It is not for the sake of living, but on account of my ³ wife, whom I had
butjust married, and left in her bridal-bed, when 1 set out on my voyage,
and, unfortunately, the momentI landed, was ssain by Hector: the love

of her makes me very unhappy, all 1 wilh for is but to see her for a short

country. The Greeks paid him divine honours, and erected a temple to him, and instituted a
solemn annual festival, called by his name, in commemoration of him. The fable, ofhis re-
turning to life for a day, is mentioned by Philostratus, Minutius- felix, and some others. Ser-
vius, in a note on a paffage in the AEneid, tells us, that Laodomia was so terrified at the retum

of her hulband to life, that she expired in his armS.
