ZEPHYRUS.,

It is of her I meanto speak.

NOTUS.

That Jupiter is in love with her, 1 knew before.

ZEPHYRUS.

1 know you did ; but attend to what followed ε Europa wandered to the
sea-(hore, to divertherself with her eompanions, when Jupiter, purting on
the form of a bull, came and sported with them. Most beautiful did he ap·
pear, for he was milk·white, his countenance mi·d and gentle, and his
horns turned back in the most graceful manner3 he leaped and played about
the shore, and lowed so delightfully‚ that Europa ventured to get upon him.
Jupiter immediately ran off with her, as fast as possible into the sea, and swam
away. She, frightened out of her wits, with one hand laid hold of his horn,
that she might not fall off, and with the other took up her robeS, that were

tost about by the wind.

round them, and sometimesjust touching the waves with their feet, bore
lighted torches, and sung hymeneaIS. The Nereids‚ half naked, rifing
from the water, rode on the backs of dolphins, andjoined in the chorus of
applause. The Tritons, and Sea—nymphs, all that the element could pro-

ascending in his charior, with Amphitrite, led the way rejoicing, and was
brideman to his happy brother. Above all, two Tritons, carrying Venus
reclining in her ffiell, and seattering fiowers of every kind in the way before
the bride ε thus they proceeded from Phoenicia quite to Crete. When they
arrived at the issand, Jupiter appeared no longer in the form of a bull, but
in his own, taking Europa by the band, led her, blussiing, and with down·

cast eyes, into the Diei-aean eave: we returned to the seaq and, according
to our several departnie11t3‚ moved the waves of it.
