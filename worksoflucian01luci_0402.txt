355 HERMoTrmus.

these things, one of their little lacquies should ask them how they are to pro-
cure the neceffaries of life, or pay the rent for their house which has been
long due; they grow angry, as if the afker had deprived them, by the question,
of all their promised happinesS, and it is a chance if they do not bite his nose
offfor it. Be not you, therefore, my good friend, in like manner enraged
at me, if, whilst you are flying in the air, digging up treasures, or encou-
raging vain and idle fancies, and hoping for things which can never be ob-
tained , Ι, out of friendffiip and regard, suffer you not to remain all your life
in a dream, how sweet soeret it is, but force you to rise up, and go about
those necefl'ary works that are agreeable to nature, and to reason. What
you were lately upon, was every whit as absurd as Hippocentaurs, Gor-
gons, and chimeras 2 any of those things that poets and painters have feigned,
which never were, or could be; and yet the multitude believe in thern, and
see them, only because they are strange, improbable, and ridiculous. Thus
you, Hermotimus, because you had heard from some idle fabulist, that there
was a certain beauteous form, superior to every thing else in nature, excelling
the Graces and celestial Venus; not confidering whether it was true, or if
any such beauty existed, immediately fell in love with her: as they say Me·
dea did with Jason in a dream. But what missed you, and all those who fell
in love with the same empty fhade, was, if I mistake not, that 116 who re-

commended her to you, as soon as he found that you implicitly believed him,
went on with success, and made his whole description so coherent, that he
eafily conducted you to your beloved ε none of you, in the mean time, en-
quired, whether you were going the right way or not: or, if your guides had
not missed you, but followed the steps of him that went before, as ssteep do
those of their leader : when you ought, before you entered the path, to have
considered, whether you should strike into it at all.

But, perhaps, you may understand the argument better by a similitude.
Suppose, for instance, one of your adventurous poets should tell you of a
man who had three heads and fix hands3 if you swallow this, without con-
fidering whether it is poffible or not, he immediately goes on to inform you
that this man had likewife fix eyes, and as many earS, that he spoke with
three voices at a time, eat his food with three mouthS, that instead of
ten fingers, as we have, he had thirty3 if he made a warrior of him, he
would put into three of his hands a target, a basket-hilr, and a ffiield, and
into the other three an axe, a launce, and a sword: and who could deny
