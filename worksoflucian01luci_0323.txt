wrinkled with care, rich only in those fingers which handled his thousand
thousand talents3 scraping up those treasures which will soon be squandered
away by his happy successor. But why do not we set sail ? We may laugh
at these wretches as we go along.

Corne in then, that Charon may cast anchor. .

C H A R O N.
Holla, there 3 where are you coming? The boat is full. You must stay
behind z we will carry you early to-morrow morning.

M 1 C Y L L U S.

It is ufing me very ill, Charon, not to take me now, when you know 1
died yesterday. I will bring an indietment against you before Rhadaman-
thus. They are setting sail, andI shall be left here by myself: but why
rhould not Ι swim after them? 1 think I am strong enough, and, being
dead already, lneed not be afraid of suffocation: befides, I have not a

half-penny left to pay the ferryman.

C L O T H O.
What are you about ? Stay, Micyllus, you must not come that way.

M I C Y L L U S.
Perhaps, 1 may be over as soon as you.

C L 0 T H Ο,
N0‚ no, that must not be: we’ll put in for him: help him in, Mer-

cury. CHARoN.

And where can he fit now ? You see we are brim full.

M E R C U R Y.
O, clap him on the tyrant's ssioulders.

C L Ο T H Ο.
A good thought of Mercury’s: come, get astride, and kiek the rascal’s

neck, and now a good voyage to us !

C Y N I S C U S.
Charon, I must even tell you the plain truth, Ι have not a half-penny to

pay you for my paffage; 1 have nothing but this pouch, which you see
here, and my staff. Iwill pump for you, however, if you please, or row,
if you will help me to a good strong oar.
