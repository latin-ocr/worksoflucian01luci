THE

SALE ος PHILOSOPHERS.

ADIALOGUE.

T he ‘Title of this Dialogue in the Original is Βιων neam, which ‘Trarfiators have
interpreted, Vanum Anemo, or, the AucnoN oF L1ves: but where there

is no Bidding one upon another, we cannot, with argy Proprzety‚ call it an Αυὲὶίοηε
‘we have, indeed, no Authority to suppose the Ancients ae-quainted with this

NIelhod of selling Goods‚ at least, according to our modern Idea of it,-
Ι have therefore called it, what it certainly is, THE SALE OF Pmtoso-

PHERs, whom Lucum thinks proper to put up, as so margy Slaves‚ in the
Market-Place. The abfitra Tenets, Modes, and Principles of every Se& are here
exposed with irfinite Humour. It may not be improper to observe, that throughout
this Dia-logne, by the Life of the Philofhpher, (a peculiar mode of Exprcffion) is un-

derstood, the Philosopher hinfi’lf.

JUPITER.

PREPARE the seats there, and get the place ready for the company;
bring out the goods in order, but brush them up first, that they may
appear handsome, and invite customers to purchase them. Yon, Mercury,
must be eder, and give notice to the buyers to affemble at the place of sale :
we intend to fell philosophers of every se& and denomination whatsoever :

if they cannot pay ready money for them, they may give security‚ and

we will trust them till next year.

A large croud is already affembled : we must have no delay.

Regin the sale then.
