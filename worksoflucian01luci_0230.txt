the nature of their ἕ pickle. It was no easy matter to know one from an- .
other : for, when their bones are laid bare, they are all alike 3 nor were we
able, till we had for a long time reviewed, to distinguish them, as they laid
one upon another, without any of those marks, or that finery, which we
knew them by whilst upon earth3 so that, when a heap of skeletons were
got together, all resembled one another, with their ghastly terrifying looks,
and shewing their naked teeth ε Icould not know Thersites from the beau-
tisul Nereus, the beggar Irus from the king of the Phaeacians, or Pyrrhias
the cook from Agamemnon ; for not the least ancient mark remained3 their
bones were all alike, without so much as a title to distinguish them.
Refle&ing on these thing5‚ l could not help comparing human life to a
long † public ssiew, where Fortune‚ aiting the Choragus, disposes all things,
and puts on the several habits of those who walk in it: to one 1116 gives the
tiara, appoints him satraps, and crowns him with a diadem3 another she
clothes in the gai-b of a ssave ; one she adorns, and renders beautiful ;> an-
other 1116 makes deformed and ridiculous3 for the spef’tacle must have va-
riety: often, even in the middle of the ceremony, will 1116 change the
dreffes of some, and not permit them to go through the shew as they set
out. Croesus she forced to take the habit of a ssave; to Maeandrius, who
had long walked in the proceffion as a servant, 1116 transferred the monarchy
of PolycrateS, and suffered him for a while to strut in the royal robe.
When, at length, the shew is over, every one gives back his garment, and,
laying it aside, together with his body, becomes just as he was before, and
in nothing differing from his neighbour. Some, when Fortune came to strip
them of their robe, were foolish enough to murmur and be angry, refus-
ing to give back, what was but lent them for a time, as if they had been
deprived of something which they considered as their own. So have you
often seen the ss actors of the tragic scene, who appear sometimes as Creons,
then as Priams, then as Agamemnons, as the drama requires of them3 and

ἃ Pickle.] Lucian calls it ταρικεια, conditura; what the preparation was, which the AEgyp-
tiaris made use of to preserve their dead bodies, was a secret to the ancients, and, 1 believe,
remains so to this day.

ἢ Public fhew.] 'l his comparison of Lucian’s is to the last degree just, elegant, and beauti-
ful, and cannot be sufficiently admired. ⁸

ξ The aelon] This naturally reminds us of Shakespeare’s comparison ε

Life—is a poor player‚
Who struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more, &c-
