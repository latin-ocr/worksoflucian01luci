CHARoiv is one of LucrAn’s best Dialogues, abounding in true Wt and Humom,
great Eafi’ and Elegance of Language‚ with mcst judicious Obfhrvations, and
fhund Morality.

CHARON, MERCURY.

=·MERCURY.

HARON, what makes you so merry? how happens it that you leave
your boat, and come thus into open day—light, you, who never used
to trouble yourself about any thing in these upper regions?

CHARON.

Iwanted, you must know, Mercury, to see what was going forward in
human life, how mortals employ themselves in it, and what those precious
things are which they so much lament the loss of, when they come down to
us3 for not one ferries over with me but weeps bitterly : wherefore, begging
Pluto's leave of absence only for a day, like the Theffalian youth, you see
rne arisen to light, and happy am 1 to have lit on you, as I know you will
wall< about with, and ssiew me every thing 3 for there is nothing here but
what you are well acquainted with.

MERCURY.

to transa& for my master Jupiter, which I must go aboutimrnediately; he is
pretty hasty, and ifl delay it, Iam afraid, may confign me entirely over to
darknesS, and give me leave to wait on nobody but yourself3 or, perhaps, -
take me by the beel, as he formerly served ⁴* Vulcan‚ and throw me head·

as mentioned by himself, in his speech to Juno‚ in the first book of Homer’s Iliad!

Once, in your cause, 1 felt his matchless might,
Hurl'd headlong‚ downward‚ from th’ aethereal height 3
