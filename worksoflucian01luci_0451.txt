my peregrination was no more than a certain impatience of mind, and thirst
after novelty, with adefire of knowing where the sea ended, and what kind
of men inhabited the several shores of it; for this purpose I laid in a large
stock of provifion, and as much water as I thou2ht necessary, taking along
with me fifty companions of the same mind as myself. I prepared withal, a
number of arms, with a skilfull pilot, whom we hired at a confiderable ex·
peuce, and made our ship (for it was a pinnace), as tight as we could in
case of a long and dangerous voyage. ,

We sailed on with a prosperous gale for a day and a night, but being still
in fight ofland‚ did not make any great way3 the next day, however, at
sun-rifing, the wind springing up, the waves ran high, it grew dark, and wc
could not unfurl a sail; we gave ourselves up to the winds and waves, and
were toffed about in a storm, which raged with great fury for threescore and
nineteen days, but on the eightieth the sun shone bright‚ and we saw not far
from us an issand, high and woody, with the sea round it quite calm and
placid, for the storm was over: we landed, got out, and happy to· escape
from our troubles, laid ou-rselves down on the ground for some time, after
which we arose, and chufing out thirty of our company to take care of
the veffel, I remained on shore with the other twenty, in order to take a
view of the interior part of the issand.

About three stadia from the sea, as we passed through a wood, we found, a
pillar of brass, with aGreek inscription on it, the characters almost effaced ;
we could make out however these words, “ thus far came l-lercules and Bac·
chus :'’ near it were the marks of two footsteps on a rock, one os them mea·
sured about an acre, the other something less3 the smaller one appeared to
me to be that of Bacchus, the larger that of Hercu1les; we paid our adora-
tions to the deities, and proceeded. We had not got far before we met with
a river, which seemed exactly to resemble wine, particularly that of ³(- Chios ι
it was of a vast extent, and in many places navigable ; this circumstance in·
duced us to give more credit to the inscription on the pillar, when we per·

⁴· OfChios.] Among the Greek wines‚ so much admired by ancient Epicures, those of the
issands of the Archipelago were the most celebrated, and of these the Chian wine, the produ&¹
of Chios, bore away the palm from every other, and particularly that which was made from
vines growing on the mountain called Arevisia, in testimony of which it were easy, if necessary,

to produce an amphora full of claffical quotations.
The present inhabitants of that issand make a small quantity of excellent wlne for their own

use, and are liberal of it to strangers who travel that way, but dare not, being under Turkisti
governrnent, cultivate the vines well, or export the produ& of them.
