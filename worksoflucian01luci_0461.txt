Coronus, the son of Cottiphion, is kingthere. Ι remember, Τ Aristophanes
the poet, speaks of him, a man of wisdom and veracity, the truth of whose
writings nobody can call in question. About three days after this, we saw the
ocean very plainly, but no land, except those regions which hang in the air,
and which appeared to us all bright and fiery. The fourth day, about noon, the
wind subfiding‚ we got safe down into the sea. No sooner did we touch the
water, but we were beyond measure rejoiced. We immediately gave every
man his supper, as much as we could afford3 and afterwardsjumped into
the sea and swam, for it was quite calm and serene.

It often happens, that prosperity is the fore—tunner of the greatest missor-
tunes. We had sailed but two days in the sea, when early in the morning
of the third, at sun-fise, we beheld on a sudden, several whales, and one
amongst thern, of a most enormous fize, being not less than fifteen hundred
stadia in length3 he came up to us with his mouth wide open, disturbing
the sea for a long way before him, the waves dashing round on every fide3 he
whetted his teeth, which looked like so many long spears, and were white as
ivory: we embraced and took leave of one another, expeffing him every
moment3 he came near, and swallowed us up at once, ship and all : he did
not, however, crush us with his teeth, for the veffel luckily ssipped through
one of the interstices: when we were got in, for some time it was dark, and we
could see nothing3 but the whale happening to gape, we beheld a large
space, big enough to hold a city with ten thousand men in it; in the middle
were a great number of small fifh, several animals cut in pieceS, sails and
anchors of ships, men’s bones, and all kinds of merchandize: there was
likewise, a good quantity of land, and hills, which seemed to have been
formed of the mud which he had swallowed : there was also a wood,

ed to vegetate ι the extent of this might be about two hundred- and forty ssa-
dia. We saw, also, several sea-birdS, gulls, and ki'ng-fissiers, makingtheir
nests in the branches. At our first arrival in* these regions, we could not
help stxedding tears; in a little time, however, I roused my companionS, and
we repaired our veffel3 after which, we sat down to supper on what the
