HARMONIDES‚

T his little Piece of Lucrtmffs carries with it the Appearance of a Letter addreffed'
to ſsime very great Man, probably the prime ,Ming'ster of Macedonia, whose Fa·
vour he was ambitious tov obtain, as the certain Road to Honour and Fre-ferment«
A Vein of Panegyric and Flattery, not often to be met with in this Author, runs
through it, which seems in sbme Measure to call in Qestion the genuineneſs of it.

· NJ Readers will determine fhr themselves, with regard to its Azethenticity.

ARMONIDES thus spake, of old, to his master, * Timotheus; “ in-
form me, if poffible (said he), howI may become famous amongst

men, and known throughout all Greece3 greatly, l must acknowlege‚ arn
Ialready indebted to you, who have taught me to tune the flute well, to
blow it sweetly and harmonioussy, to place my fingers properly, to keep-
time, to perceive the character of every † mode, the divine breathing of the
Phrygian, the solemn gravity of the Doric‚ the softness and beauty of the
Ionie; all this I learned from you3 butI arn not yet arrived at that perfec-
tion, which I was ambitious of, in finging to it, which would =procure me
fame and glory, which would render rne so illustrious, that men should point
at rne as I pass along, and say, there goes Harmonidcs‚ the prince of mufi-
cians3 in the same manner as when you came first fron] Boeotia, performed
in the ‚l‘ Pandionides, and gained the victory in Ajax, your name-sake hav·

’ἢ Timotheus] One of the most celebrated poets and muficians of antiquity. He was born at
Miletus, an Ionian city of Caria, 446 years before Christ, a contemporary οῖ’ Philip or* Macedon,
and, according to Dryden’s Ode, of Alexander also, excelled in lyric and dithyrambic poetry‚
and no less in his performance on the cithara. According to Pausanias, he added four new
strings to that instrument, which before had only seven, for which he was banissied by virtue of¹
a curious Spartan a& o'r‘ parliament, quoted, from Causabon, by Dr. Burney, in his history of
Greek Music, and which l shall here subjoin. for the entertainment of my readers.

⁶⁶ Whereas Timotheus the Milefian, coming to our city, has dishonoured our ancient music,
and, despiling the lyre of seven strings, has, by the introduStion ofa gre-ater variety of notes,
corrupted the ears of our youth, and, by the number of his strings, given to our mufic an
effeminate dress, the kingS, and the ephori, have therefore result-ed to pass censure on him,
and to oblige him to cut off his superfluous striugs, and to banish him from our city, that nienr
rna)- be warncd‚ &c.” See Burney, vol. i. page 407.

ᾧ Modus] For a full and accurate account of the modes, I must referthe carious reader to=
Burney's Dissertation on the Music of the Ancients, vol. i. page 47.

ss Pandiontdcs.] Some tragedy ofthat name, not now extant, on the story of Progne and P‘ni-

lomela, daughters os Pandion.
