THE

TYRANT-KILLER.

This Piece is ascribed to Lucum, and to be met with, I believe, in every Edition of his
Wnrks, though the Reader will not find a Grain of the Sal Atticum, or Luciani-
cum, in any Part of it. It seems, indeed, to be nothing but a juvenile Exercise, like
the Declamations now written andspoke l3y our Yoang Nsen at both Univetfities.
In which Case, it may pcffibly have been penned by LUC1ANfor one ofhis Pupils.
As considered in this Light, and in this only, we may receive it as his, without In-
jury to his Characfier. An affecfied Subtilty of Argument, and Tinfi‘l Eloquence,
runs through the whole, which smells strongly of the Schools, andpoints out the
Falſse Teste which began to prevail in the Age when LuchN lived, and which,

spon after, over-spread the W'orld of Science and Literature. ERASMUS has taken
the Trouble to write an Answer to the Urunt-Killer, longer than Lucum’s, and
to say the T ruth, almost as dull and uninteresting.

N one day, O reverend judges, Ihave ssain two tyrantS‚ one advaneed

in years, the other in the flower of youth, and prepared to commit more
injuries3 and for this I now appear before you, soliciting but one reward.
The only tyrant·killer who ever destroyed two wicked men at one blow. The
son fell by my sword, the father by his paternal affeetion for him. The ty-
rant suffered the punishment he deserved, by seeing his son ssain before him,
and was afterwards, wonderful to relate, forced to be his own tyrant-killer.
The son periffied by my hand, and, when dead himself, was the instrument
‘ of another murther: in his life, the partner of his father's crimes, and after
death, his father's murtherer. I alone have put an end to the tyranny‚ it is
my sword alone which has done all. I have reversed the common method of
ssaying the base and wicked‚ Ihave ssain the ssrongest and most powerful
with my own hand, and left the weak old man to the sword alone. For
deeds like these, I expe& from you a double reward, and that 1 should have
been paid for as many as 1 have ssain. As 1 not only saved you from the
present, but delivered you from the fear of future evils3 made your liberty
secure, and left no heir to· perpetuate the same crimes hereafter. In the mean
time, I find myself in danger of lofing the reward of all my service53 and 1
alone {hall suffer by those laws, which I myself was the preserver of. My
