Socrates was walking about, and disputing with every body, accompanied
by Palamedes, Nestor, Ulyffes, and all the old praters; his legs seemed to
be swelled with the poisonous draught which he had taken. As for my worthy

groaning, and lamenting their lost grandeur, laughs at, and diverts himself
with them3 sometimes lying along upon the ground, and, with a most

council. Many things were agitated, and at last came on the affair of the
rich: a number of accusations was brought against them, such as pride,

violence, oppreffion, and injustice3 when, at length, one of the dema-
gogues rose up, and read the following decree.

THE DECREE.

enormous abuses‚ plundering, oppreffing, and by every other means shewing
their contempt of the poor; the senate and people do hereby enac't, that
when they die, the bodies of the said rich men shall be punished as the
bodies of other misereants are, and their souls sent back again into life, me-
