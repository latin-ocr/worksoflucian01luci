you ; and well he might. Man will boldly attempt every wickedness, whilst
Jove is thus cold and inaCtive. What should hinder him, indeed, when
you, as if stupified by ’ᾗ mandragora, are fast asseep: you, who neither
hear the perjured, nor observe the wicked; blind to every thing about you,
and with your ears stopped, like an old dotard. When you were young,
lively, and prone to resentment, you never spared the guilty and oppreflive ;

ssiafts perpetually darting down upon them. Then we had earthquakes in
abundance, snow in heaps, hail like stones, and, to speak plainly to you,
most violent and rapid showers, and rivers overflowing every day. VVitness

* Salmoneus] Salmoneus was theson of AEolus, and brother to the famous Sisyphus. He
conquered all Elis ς and growing, like other conquerors, intoxicated with success, took it into his
head, as Alexander did long after him, that he must be king of the godS. To prove his di-
vinity, he built a large bridge of brass‚ over an immense plain, and rolled upon it chariots of
brass, by way of imitating Jupiter's thunder; and that he might also have a little good light-
ning with it, threw down firebiands from it on a few devoted viCtims below. Jupiter, not ap-
proving the humour of so poor a inimic, sent him to Tartarus. Virgil has immortalised him

in the following lines, in his description of the Pagan Hell :

Vidi crudeles dantem Salmonea poenas
Dum flammas Jovis δε sonitus imitatur Olympi·

-i- Afandragora,] Mandragora, or the mandrake, is an herb, or plant, of a cold and narcotie
quality, especially the root, which is large, and shaped like those of parsnip, carrot, white
briony‚ διε. its roots are sometimes for-keil, which, perhaps, made the superstitious imagine
they resembled the legs or thighs of men; Columella therefore calls it semihomo. The idea
of its soporific quality is adopted by the modern as well as ancient mturalists.

not poppy nor mandragora

Nor all the drowsy syrups of the East,

Shall ever med'cine thee to that sweet sseep

Which thou owed’st yesterday. Shakspeare's Othello.
