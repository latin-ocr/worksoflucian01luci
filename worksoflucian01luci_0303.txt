dogs; throw but a bone, they all sally out, bite one another, and bark at
him that carries it off.

Once, upon a time, a certain AEgyptiau monarch, we are told, taught
some apes to dance the ἥ Pyrrhic dance ; the beasts (for they mimic every
human action), soon learned their leffon, and sszipped about in masszs, and
purple robes, and the fight pleased for a long time; till an arch fellow‚ who
came as a spectator, took some nuts out of his bosom, and threw a handful
amongst them, when the performers immediately forgot their profeffion,
and, from Pyrrhic doncerS, returned to mere apes again, tore off their masks
and cloaths, and went to fighting for the fruit: thus was the celebrity at
once diffdved, to the great diverfion of the spectator& And just in the
same manner do these men aet. These 1 have exposed, nor will I ever cease

such as resemble you (for many still there are who follow true philosophy,
and observeyourlaws), I were mad indeed, to utter any thing severe, or
disrespeC'ml. What, indeed, could 1 say, or what is in there in your lives
similar to theirs? But, surely, to detest those who are insolent to men, and
hateful to the godS, is meritorious. What is there in you, Pythagoras, or
Plat0‚ or Aristotle, or Chrysippm, that has the least similitude with them?
As the proverb says, it is † Hercules and the ape ε do they imagine them· ’

philosophize? I could even bear all this, if they ac‘ted their parts well3 but
a vultur more resembles the nightingale, than they do the real philosopher.
