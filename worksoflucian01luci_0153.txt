’ Enipeus, you were too proud and indifferent, to treat so fine a girl, who
carne every day after, and was fond of you, with such contempt, and to
give her so much uneafiness; she pined and wandered about the (hore, and
used to wath there, in hopes of lighting on you, and you deceived her.

E N Ι P E U S.
And ought you, therefore, to have stolen my love, to put on the form

of EnipeuS, and delude ruy fimple Tyro?
N E P T U N E.
Enipeus, you were indifferent before, and now, it is too late, you grow
jealous ε but the girl is never the worse for it, as she mistook me for you.
‚ E N 1 P E U S.
How so? You told her, when you came away, that you were Neptune,
which made her miserable: I, in the mean time, am basely wronged, and

you enjoyed that happiness which ought to have been mine, and, covered by
the purple flood, poffeffed my beloved girl.

N E P T U N E.
. You, Enipeus, please to remember, thought fit to reject her.
