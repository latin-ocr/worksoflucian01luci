Their estates ε, both being of the same age, both made their wills publie;
Maerichus, in case he should die first, left an he had to Aristeas3 and Aristeas,
to Maerichus, on the same condition ε the testaments on both fides figned
and sealed, each of thern strove to outdo the other in constant attendance
and mutual adulation ε the soothsayers, as well those who guess at futurity
from the stars, as the sons of Chaldaea, who presage by dreams, even the
Pythian himself sometimes leaned towards Aristeas, and sometimes to Mae-

richus, and the scale was held a long time in equal ballance between them.

Both died in one day3 and their estates came to their relationS, Euno-
mius and Thraficles, who had never dreamed of such good fortune. The

troubled our heads with each other; nor did 1 ever with for Antisthenes's
death, that his staff (for he had an excellent strong one, made out of box),
might descend to me3 no more than you, 1 believe, Crates, defired my

beans in it.

What they were so anxious about, DiogeneS, were things which neither
you nor 1 wanted: what .1 really wanted, and what you had from Antist-
henes, and what, as it were by hereditary right, 1 received from you, were
greater treasures, and far morevaluable than the Perfian empire.

DIOGENES.

What may they be?
C R A Τ E S.

Wisdorn, sels-complacency‚ truth, boldness, freedom, liberty.

D 1 Ο G E N E S.
These, by Jupiter, 1 remember were left me by AntistheneS, and these,

and more than these, did 1 bequeath to Crates,
