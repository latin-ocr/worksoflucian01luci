*PARRHESIADES
Know then, O Philosophy, that Diogenes has not advanced every thing

against me which he might have done, but, for what reason 1 know not,
has passed over many accusations, much heavier than any he has yet pro-
duced : for my own part, so far am Ι from denying any thing 1 have said,
or thinking that it stands in need >of a defence in this place, that 1 had re·
solved, before I came here, that whatever he might forget to mention, or Ι
had not thought of before, I would now take the opportunity to add, that
you might be a betterjudge what kind of menl put up to sale, and branded
with the name of boasters and hypocrites : above all, Ι must beg you to
observe, that 1 have said nothing of any rnan but what is true: and, if the
reflections appear harsh or cruel, those who do the evil are to blame, and

but, keeping their footsteps firm, and their eyes always fixed on the rules
prescribed by you, direct their lives according to them, which, indeed, but
few, even of your followers, are able to perform. But when I beheld such
numbers, not smitten with the love of Philosophy, but from a thirst after
that glory and honour, which accompany her; by those external appear·
ances, which all may eafily put on, aping the good and great in their beard,
their habit, or their wall< ; and, at the same time, in their lives and manners,
belying their profession, debafing its dignity, and a&ing in dire& oppofi-
tion to your precepts; i must own, I could not look upon them without
indignation. T'ney seemed to me like some tragic actor, who, though soft
and effeminate himself, should play the part of Achilles, or Theseu3, or Her-

Free Speaker. Seneca, in like manner, calls Demochares, ParrhefiadeS, “ ita, says he, ob ni.
