300 ONDEPENDANTS.

Having thus traced the cause, let us now confider, first, the miseries
which they undergo, before they are admitted into this society3 in the next
place, what happens to them when they are there, and lastly, what, after
all, is the catastrophe of the drama.

And first, then, there must be a great deal of running backwards and for-
wards, and waiting at the doors; you must rise early, stay a long time,
bear much, must be shut out, perhaps, or called impertinent by a blunder-
ing * Syrian porter, or an African nomenclator, whom you must take care
to fee well, that they may not forget to give in your name: you must dress
yourself, withal, beyond your circumstanceS, according to the rank of your
patron, and chufe such colours for your cloaths as are most agreeable to him,
for fear he should be affront'cd when he sees you: then be sure you follow
him close, or rather pushed on by his ssaves, join his train, walk before him,
and make a part of his pompous attendance: and, after all, perhaps, for
several days he may never so much as look upon you ε if, at last, you are so
happy as to be seen by him, if he should call to you, and ask you a ques-
tion, any thing, perhaps, that comes uppermost, then your head turns
round, you sweat and tremble, and all that are by laugh at your consufion.
If he asks you who was king of the Greeks, you answer, they had a thou-
sand ship53 this the good—natured will call modesty, the bold and impudent
will style it timidity, and the malevolent will attribute it to your ignorance:

over-complaisant, take your leave, heartily afhamed of your foolifh diffi-
dence. &Vhem at length, after you

Long sseepless nights in heavy arms have stood,
And sweat laborious days in dust and blood,

as the † poet says, though not fighting for fair Helen, or Priam's Troy,
but in hopes of getting five sarthings, by the affistance of fortune, or some
tragedy god, you corne to the trial, and to be examined whether you are a
man of letters ; for the rich and great are fond of this kind of business, as it

* Syrianporter.] The great men of Rome, at that time, we may suppose, kept Syrian por-
ters at their doors, as we, not long fince, used to employ Swiss in that office. What Luciam
calls the οιημακλητως, was probably another kind of servant, who, like our footmen, announced
the company as they came in. ‘1 he appointing blundering foreigners to this employment was

thought, as amongst us, a mark of distinetion amongst their nobility, who were, in many of
their customs, almost as proud and ridiculous as our own.

† As the poet sayn] See Achilles' speech, in the ninth book of the Iliad.
