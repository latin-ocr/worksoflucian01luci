30 TIMON.

haps, some person at the ‘³³‘ Olympic games; who dees it not, because he
thinks it a duty, but merely because it is an old custom. In a little time, most
generous of deities as you are, you will let thern dethrone yon, as they did
Saturn. I forbear mentioning their sacrilegious attacks of your temple,
or their laying hands even upon yourself at Olympia, when you, the
great thunderer, never so much as set on the dogs, nor called in your
neighbours to help you take the thieves, when they ran away. The noble
giant-queller, and conqueror of the ἢῆ* Titans, sat quietly, with his thunder-
bolt often cubits length in his hand, and let them pull the hair off his
head. &Vhem O thou great deity ! wilt thou cease to pass over these thingS,
or when wilt thou repay this wickedness? How many ‡ Phaetons, how
many Deucalions will suffice, to expiate such iniquity? But to leave this
general cause, and come to my own: Ι, who have raised so many Athe-
nians from poverty and misery to riches and power, affisted the indigent,
and lavifhed away all my substance to make my friends happy, arn now
myself left poor and destitute. I arn not so much as known by them;
those will not condescend to look upon me, who formerly revered, adored
mc, and hung upon my nod. If by chance, asI go along, I meet with
any of them, they pass by me as they would by the grave-stone of a
person long fince dead, that was worn out, and fallen to decay, as
if they had never seen me; others turn away from me as from a loath-
sume and abhorred spectacle, though not long since they extolled me as
their benefactor and preserver. Reduced, at length, to the utmost distress,
and clothed in a garmeni: made of skins, Idig this little spot of earth,

ἃ Olymps‘c gamss ;] The Olymp‘tc gaines were celebrated in honour of jupiter, at, or near,
the city Olympia, otherwise called Pisa, upon the river Alpheus, in Peloponnesus. For a full
account orthem, l refer my readers to Mr. Gilbert West's excellent dissertation on them, in
the third volume of his wmks, printed for Dodssey‚ 1776.

{- Timan] Titan, according to the ancient theogony‚ was the eldest son of Coelus and Vesta,
or heaven and earth; but getting, it scema, under pettieoat governrnent‚ was persuaded by
his mother to give up his birth-right, no less than the empire of the universe, to his younger
brother, Sarum, on condition that, in process of time, he would cut offthe entail‚ by putting
to death all his male heirs, that so the kingdom might revert to the elder branch3 but dis-
covering, sometime after, that, by the artifice of Rhea, three of Saturn’s sons had been se.
cretly preserved and educated, he waged war against his brother, subdued, and took him and
his wife and children prisoners. Jupiter, however, as soon as he arrived at years of rna·
turity‚ set all his family free again, conquered the Titanus, and sent them all to Tartarus.

ἶ, Pl1aetons‚] How many conflagrations, and how many deluges must happen, how often
must this wicked world be burned, or drowned, before it will be thoroughly reformed!
