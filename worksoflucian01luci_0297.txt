stration, so attractive and commanding, which all unite in Plato, sufficiently
point out the proper person ε you, therefore, must open the cause, and speak
for us all. Now call to mind, and bring together, all the good things you
have said against Gorgias, and Polus, and Prodicus, and Hippias: for this
man is more formidable than either of thern. Sprinkle, withal, a little

irony, and some of those pretty interrogatories‚ in which you so abound,
Add, moreover, if you ple-ase, that inexpreffible charm, which will put the

great Jupiter, who drives the swift charior, into a paffion if he is not con-

demned.

By no means appoint me, but rather one of these much {harper orators‚
Diogenes here, or Antisthenes, or Crates, or you, Chrysippus: we do not
want elegance or strength of style upon this occafion, but a regular judicial
process. We will leave oratory to Parrhefiades.

Well then: Iwill begin the accusation3 nor will there be need of any
long speeches about it. I have most reason, for he has treated me worse

than any of you, and sold me for two oboli.

P L A Τ O.

Diogenes, O Philosophy, will speak for us all: but, remember, my worthy
friend, in your accusation, to have an eye, not only to yourself alone, but
to the common cause: if we happen to disagree amongst ourselves in opi-
nion, you are not to enter into examination, or determine which is in the
right3 but confine your resentment to the injuries done to Philosophy her-
self, abused and calumniated by Parrhefiades : and, leaving our diffenfions
untouched‚ defend strenuoussy what we have in common one with another:
remember, we have appointed you alone to a& for us, we trust our all to
you, and on you it will depend, whether what we do shall appear fair and
honest, or be deerned what he has thought fit to call it.

D I O G E N E S.
Never do you sear: I shall omit nothing, but speak as well as I can for

you all: if, perchance, Philosophy, overcome by his eloquence, for she is
ofa mild and gentle disposition, should, after aii, aequit hirn, it shall not
be my fault3 I will stick close to the cause, and endeavour to convince him,

that Ι do not bear the ᾖ staffin vain.
