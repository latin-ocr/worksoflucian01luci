more, I will have a kiss when you give it, and when you take it away from
me. Why these tears? child, do not be afraid: whoever affronts you shall
suffer for it.

beloved.

Not so neither3 but Ι cannot bear to hear you abuse him ε you only do

any other writer, that Galatea was fond of Polypheme; who, as the story is generally related,

right as another to tell it his own way.
