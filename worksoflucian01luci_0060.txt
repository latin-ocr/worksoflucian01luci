with them, and yet acknowlege them under their own hands at the last
hour; some ordering their cloaths, or any thing else, which they most de-
lighted in, to be burned with thern on the funeral pile; others commanding
servants ‘to warch at their sepulchres3 others defiring to have their tombs
hung with garlands: persevering thus in error and absurdity, even beyond
the grave. One might eafily conjecture, he thought, what kind of lives
they must have led, who could order such things to be done after their deaths.
These are the men that purchase the most costly dainties, and mix ἥ saffron
and spices with their wine3 such as are crowned with † roses in the midst of
winter, which they are fond of then, only because they are rare and out of

season ; and yet, at the proper time, when produced by nature alone, utterly
reject and despise them3 such as use ointments and perfumes3 men, who

did not even know, for which he most condemned them, how to enjoy those

pleasures which they were perpetually in search of, but miffed their aim, and
destroyed their own end and purpose, by leaving their minds a prey to con-
tinual dissipation3 coming in, as upon the stage, ‡ any way rather than by
the street—door3 this he called a solecism in pleasure. As § Momus found fault
with nature, for not placing the ox’s horns before his eyes3 in like manner
did he laugh at these fools, for placing their perfumed crowns on their heads,
for, as he observed‚ if they are so fond of roses and violets, they should

³* Saffi·o›1 and spices,] Plutarch, in his Symposia, mentions the mixing saffron with wine, 'as
an article of fashionable luxury; this is a species, however, of ancient Ep1curism which the
moderns have not hitherto adopted.

ἧ- [essen] This custom is at this day as fashionable in England as it ever could have been in
Greece or Rome, no lady of the Ton appearing without winter-rose53 it even descends
to the lower orders, and a genteel footman never hires himself to a woman of quality, without
first knowing how much ssie allows a week for nosegays.

ἶ Any way rather, &c.] The Commentators on the original of this paffage are much per-
plexed, and have written two or three quarto pages about and about it, without seeming
to have discovered the true meaning, which, after all, appears to be no more than an allusion
to the entrance of the persons of the drama, at back-doors, windows, &c. Lucian's argument,
therefore, runs thus ; why will not the sons of luxury and pleasure follow the plain road and
dic'lates of nature, instead of thus turning out of her path, and coming in, like aotors on the
stage, at any entrance rather than the right?

ξ As Momm, iffa] Momus found fault with the gods, or nature, for not placing the horns
οἱ an ox rather under than above the eye, as imagining, perhaps, that in such a position they
would have acted with more force, and, consequently, been more serviceable to the animal.
Lucian tells us, in his True History, that he met with some of this kind, made according to

Mornus’s plan, but he does not tell us they were a whit the better forit. See Aristotle de Part.
