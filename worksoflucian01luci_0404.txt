norance through fear and ssiame, and because they wilh to be thought supe-
rior to the rest of mankind. But let us bury in total oblivion every thing ’
that has passed between us on this subje&; let us suppose that the Stoic
philosophy is the only true one, and that there is none besides it worthy of
our care3 letus then consider whether it be such a one as we may hope to
attain, or whether all who hitherto attempted it have laboured in vain. Ι
hear of wonderful things promised to those who arrive at the summit of it,
and that they alone possess every thing good and desireable3 but you best
know whether you have ever lit on such a perse& Stoic, as was never sub-
dued by pain, or missed by pleasure, or enssaved by paffi0n3 one who was
superior to envy, a contemnet os siches, one who, in a word, was complete-
ly happy, as he must be, who is the rule and model of perse& virtue3 for
he who is deficient in the least of these, is imperfe&, however excellent he
may be with regard to any thing else; if not, there never yet was the truly
happy and complete Stoic.

You are right, Hermotimus, to confess the truth. How then can you any
longer pursue philosophy, when you plainly perceive, that neither your
master, nor your master's master, nor any that went before him, though you
go back to the tenth generation, was everso wise as to be perfeffly happy ε
nor will it suffice to say, it is enough if you can approach nearly towards hap-
piness: this is doing nothing; for he is equally a stranger, and in the open
air, who stands on the outside of the door, be he ever so near, as he who
stands at a great distance from it, with this only difference, that he who is
nearest must be most unhappy, in being close to that felicity which he can-
not possess. Do you put yourself to all this trouble, therefore, only to get
ninii· to perfeft happiness? for such we will suppose it to be3 isit for this
alone you spend so much time, wear yourself out with warchings, and bring
yourself to the grave? For this, you say, you will labour for these twenty
years at least to come, that, after all, at fourscore, (and who can promise
you will live so long ἒ) you may be one of those who are not yet happy3
unless, indeed, you think that you alone are able to gain that, which so
many better and abler men before you, with all their toil and labour, could
never acquire. But, even taking all this for granted, ‘where is the good re-
