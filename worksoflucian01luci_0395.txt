HERMOTIMUS. 359

say of the *priestess at Adelphi, when she drinks of the second fountain,
that she is immediately full of the god, and delivers her oracles to all that
ask for them : and yet you told me but just now, that you had drank up half
the calk, and were still but as if you hadjust began.

Let us see then if we cannot furniffi you with a better comparison. Your
cask and your inn-keeper may remain ; but we will fill your veffels not with
wine, but with several sorts of grain, wheat o' top, then beans, then bar-
ley, under these lentiles, tates, and other things 3 if you wanted to buy some
of the seeds‚ and the owner should pull out some wheat by way of sample,
and put it into your hand to look at, could you tell from thence, whether
the tates were good, the lentiles fit to eat, or the beans rotten ?

Certainly, no.

Neither can you, in like manner, from what any one man calls true phi-
losophy, tell whether it be all so; for it does not all taste the same, like the
wine, which you compared it to, but has a great deal of variety in it, and
such as requires no little, or ssight examination. If you buy bad wine, you
only lose a trifle; but, according to your own account, to wallow in the
mire, is a bad affair indeed. Add to this, that he who defires to taste a
whole cask, that he may buy one bottle, does the inu-keeper a considerable
injury3 but, with philosophy, it is quite another thing: drink as much as
you please, the cask is still full, and the landlord never the worse for it: the
more you draw, as the proverb says, the more ssows in. Just the contrary
of the‡ Danaids fieve, for whatever was poured into that, ran out immediate-
ly : but here, the more you take away, the more ssill remains behind.

But Icould compare your philosophy to something else: do not think
Ῑ mean to affront you, when Ι say, it is like hemlock, aconite‚ or any other
poison: if you take only a small portion, with the tip of your finger, and

³¹* <The Priqstefi, δέω] The Pythia, or priestess of Delphi, before she ascended the tripos, used
to warh her whole body, in the Castalia, a fountain at the foot of Parnaffus3 and to drink large
draughts of the water, which never sailed to inspire her, and she immediately began to pro.

1 The Danaids.] The punishment of the Danaids in hell, for killing their hulbands, was to fill
a large tub, with holes in the bottom of it, with water, which consequently ran out as fast as
poured in. The dolium Danaidum, or Danaids fieve, paffed afterwards into a proverbial
expreffion, to signify any thing imprasticable.
