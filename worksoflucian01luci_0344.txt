losopher, or an orat0r3 he likes to have a man of your character in his train,
for then he may be thought fond of Grecian literature himself, and an ad-
mirer os those doctr'mes which it inculcates. What is this then, after all,
but to let out your heard and cloak for a few fine speeches ! You must al-
ways be seen with him, and can never stay behind, never quit your post, but
be constantly at hand to perform your duty. He, perhaps, will condes-
cend to throw his arm round, andjoke familiarly with you, to shew the
woild that, even whilst he is walking the streets, he is not forgetful of the
Muses, but employs every leisure minute to the best advantage. You, trudg-
ing along, sometimes faster, and sometimes ssower, through rough ways,
up hill and down (for such, you knovv, our city is), come in at last sweat·
ing and out of breath, and whilst he is chattering with some friend within
doorS, you stand without3 there is no place to fit down in, and, having no-
thing else to do, take out a book to divert yourself3 at length, after paffing
the day without meat or drink, about midnight you get a little supper, not

nor to expe& the same fine birds as they have, plump and crammed3 half a
chicken, or a dry pigeon may serve you; which is, no doubt, the highest
affront they can put upon you : but it often happens that if there is a scar-
city, and a new guest comes in, the servant takes away what he had put be-
fore you, and carries it to him, whispering, perhaps, in your ear, “you
are one of the family.” If a stag, or a sucking pig comes to table, you must
depend on the mercy of a kind carver, or turn ³4 PrometheuS, and help
yourself to some bones well-covered with fat: for your next neighbour who
sits above you, there is always a plate ready as long as he chuses to eat,
though nobody will help you to one : who, that had but the spirit ofa deer,
could tamely hear this ? But another thing, which I have not yet mentioned
is, that whilst every body else is drinking good old wine, you must swallow
that which is thick and good for nothing ; you take care, therefore, to drink
