How do you knOW, Charon, but he mai} be detained about bufiness. Ju-

piter, perhapS, may want him on some particular occasion in the regions
above3 and he, you know, is 1115 master.
C H A R O N.

I grant you, he 1·5; but that is no reason why he should perpetuall‘y ern·-
ploy a servant that is in common to us both : we never keep him back wherr
he 1135 done 1115 business here; but I know the bottom of it: we have no-
thing for him but asphodelus, and libations, and *salt cakes, and funeral
offerings, with clouds and‘ darkness: whilst, in heaven, all is light and
chearful: there he hasgood ambrofia, and 1166131· 111 plenty, and there he
likes to stay longest: away he flies from us as from a prison 3 but when he
is to come down again, 116 paces it very ssow, and it is with much ado we

6311 get him at last.
C L Ο Τ H O.

Do not 116 111 3 paffion, Charon, for here he 6011165, with a large tribe for
us, driving them before him with his rod, like so many goats : but what is
her-e? one os 1116111 Ι see bound, another laughing, another with 3 satchel on
his shoulder, and a club in his hand„ hoking fiercely, and pushing on the
rest: and yonder is Mercury himself, all over in 3 sweat, puffing, and blow·
ing, his feet covered 111111 dust, and half out of breath. What is the mat·
ter, Mercury? Why 311 11115 bustle? You seem mightily disturbed.

How should I be otherwise, when this rascally run—away has so haraffed

me in pursuing him, thatI had like not to have reached you t0·day..

C L O T H O.
W'hat could he mean by endeavouring 10 escape you ?

M E R C U R Y.
The meaning 15 plain enough : he wanted 10 continue longer in the land'

of the living: he is some king or tyrant, 1 suppose, by his crying and la·
menting the great happiness he has been. deprived of„

white and half black, to signify that he was sometimes employed in heaven or earth, and some--
times in the infernal regions. He had more business than all the gods put together, had a va-
riety of offices, with names expressive of them, and was, indeed, 3 perse& Mungo amongst the
deities of antiquity.

⁶ SaIt-cakesff The mmm were round broad and thin salt-cakes, which usually made 3 part
of the funeral offerings to Hecate, or the moon. No oblation, it is observable, was thought
acceptable to the gods without salt.
