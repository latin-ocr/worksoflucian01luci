ans, mules, dogs and all, with the pestilence. And, nowl arn speaking
of Apollo, I will mention some things, which the learned report concerning
him. To pass over his unfortunate amours, the ssaughter of Hyacin-
thus, and Daphne’s contempt of him, he was condemned for killing the
’Χ Cyclops, was banistmd, by † ostracism, from heaven to earth, and sen-
tenced to live like a mere mortal: he served in Thefl'aly with Admetus,
and in Phrygia under Laomedon3 with the latter, indeed, not alone, but
in company with Neptune, both of them making bricks, and hiring them-
selves out, from mere want, to build walls, for which they say the Phry-
gians never paid them their whole wages, but to this day owe thern aboi-e

How many things of this kind have the poets most gravely and pom-
poussy related concerning the gods, how many, still more solemnly‚ about

and Assyriam: how general alover he waS, and so given to venery, that he

θ’ ‘The Cyclops] Apollo lamented much the death of his son AEsculapius, but, not being able
to revenge his death on Jupiter, turned his resentment against the Cyclops, who made the thun,
der and lightning which was supposed to have destroyed that famous phyfician. Pluto, it seems,
had complained to Jupiter, that his dominions were thinned by the numbers of people whom
AEsculapius had cured, and consequently, kept upon earth. Jupiter, in compliment to his bro-
