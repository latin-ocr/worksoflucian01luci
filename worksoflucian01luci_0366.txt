HERMOTIMUS.

H E R M O T Ι M U S.
Not only so, Lycinus, but whoever is grown ἥ perse& in virtue, from
that time can never be a ssave to anger, fear, or any paffi0n3 never is affeet-

ed by sorrow, trouble, or calamity.

L Y C Ι N U S.
And yet, if one might speak the truth, but we must take care what we

say, as it were impious, I suppose, to enquire into the affairs of the wife ..—
H E R M Ο T Ι M U S.

By no means z rspeak whatever you please.
L Y C Ι N U S.

You see, my friend, Ι am afraid.
H E R M 0 T I M U S.

Fear nothing ι we are all alone.

L Y C I N U S.

To speak freely then, Hermotimus, whilst you were relating to me how
these men became wife, brave, just, and so forth, I listened with attention,
gave you credit for it all, and was pleased with your discourse: but when
you told me they despised glory and riches, and pleasures, and that they
never were angry, or uneasy, there I must own, between ourselves (for there
is nobody by), Ibegan to doubt, recolledfing what Ι had just before seen

done by a certain person, shall I name him, or is it enough —-

HERMOTIMUS-

Ο no, tell me who it was, I beseech you.

L Y C Ι N U S.
Even your own good master ; a man in all other respests truly estimablc,

and, as you know, far advanced in years.

H E R M O T Ι Μ U S.
And what did he do?
L Y C I N U S.
You know his disciple, the stranger of Heraclea, who came every day to

him to leam philosophy, a red-haired man, and rather fiery ?

’ᾖ Perfeft in virtue] This was a ἀοξὶτὶῃε worthy of the self-conceited Stoics. Little should

we expe& to find it adopted in a Christian community ι and yet of the very same nature is the
Methodists doen-ine of Affurance‚ which informs us, that the eleet, after they are once become
regenerate‚ or born anew‚ can nevel· fall back into fin, or be guilty of any crime3 a doetrine
totally opposite to the dictares of our bleffed Saviour, who bids us “ Whilst we stand take heed

lest we fall.²’
