wander for a little while on earth, and quickly to awaken from life, as from
a short dream, and leave every thing behind, surely they would live more
prudently, and die with less reluzfi’mnce: but nOW, fondly imagining they
. shall for ever enjoy their present ροίῇῌῖοηε, when the minister of death calls

upon them, and they are snatched ay on a sudden, they cannot bear to

part with life, because they so little exped’oed to be torn from it. Observe
that man, who is urging on the workmen to finisti his house with all dili-
gence, what would he not rather do, if he knew that he must die and

leave it to his heir, before he had himself once supped in it? Look on him ·
who rejoices that his wife has brought him a son, and entertains his friends
on the event, and calls the boy by his own name; if he knew that the child

should die in his seventh year, would he, think you, be so happy at his
birth? But he is thinking of one of his neighbours, who is happy in a son

’ that has conquered at the Olympio games ; and pays no regard to another,
who is carrying out his to the last fire. Mark what a croud of usurers there
is yonder, 'e' heaping. up their gold3 before they will be able to enjoy it,
they will be called away by those same meffengers whom 1 before mentioned

toyou.

say, out of the reach of fortune, you will find more wretchedness than feli-
city amongst them: surrounded as they are with tumults, fears, conspira-
cies, hatred, wrath, quarrel s, flattery, and di⁴quietude, to pass over those
sorrows and distempers, and that perturbation and anxiety of mind, ’which
they have* ln common with the vulgar: it would take up, in short, as much
time to recount their miseries as those of their inferiors.
