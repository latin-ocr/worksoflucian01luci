'TnnFlsH-ERMAN. 251

Such leagues as men and furious lions join.

L U C 1 A N.
Let Homer, then, speak for me als03 perchance you will revere his

words, and not despise the reciter.

’Ἠ Spare a good man, and, for the life I owe,

Rich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,
And steel, well‘temper’d‚ and persuafive gold 3
Which ev’n the wisest love.

P L A T Ο.
Homer will supply us with an answer too : for instance,

† Think not to live, tho’ all thy gold be shown:
Shall we dismiss thee, in some future strife,
To rissz, more bravely, thy now forfeit life ?

L U C I A Ν.
Wretch that I am! even my best hope, my Homer, fails me. Imust

fly to Euripides; he, perhaps, may save me.

Ο save the suppliant man Ξ for him, thou know’st,
’Tis impious to destroy.

P L A T Ο.
And does not the same Euripides say,

Shall not the evil-doer suffer ill?

L U C I A N.
And must Ithen be killed fora few· words only?

P L A T Ο.
By jove, you ss1a113 for, as he says in another place,

‡ The sure reward of an unbridled tongue‚
And impious pride, is misery, and woe-
L U C Ι A N.
If by no art, or subterfuge whatever, I can escape, and you are determined
to make an end of me, at least inform me what irremediable injury I have
done you, that you should thus seize upon, and condemn me.

ev’n the wisest 10ve,” are not in Homer, but added by Lucian.
