and high ; on which, we saw a prodigious large fire : fronting the prow os
our fhip, we had a view of one very broad and flat, and which seemed to be
about five hundred stadia off3 as we approached near to it, a sweet and
odoriferous air came round υς, such as Herodotus tells us blows from Arabia
Felix3 from the rose, the narcissus, the hyacinth, the lily, the violet, the
myrtle, the laurel, and the vine. Refreshed with these delightful odours, and

in hopes of being at last rewarded for our long sufferingS, we came close up
to the issand: here, we beheld several safe and spacious harbours, with clear
transparent rivers rolling placidly into the sea; meadow5, woods, and birds
of all kinds, chanting melodioussy on the ssmre3 and, on the trees, the sofr
and sweet air fanning the branehes on every fide, which sent forth a soft har-
monious found, like the playing on a flute; at the same time we heard a
noise, not of riot or tumult, but a kind ofjoyful and convivial found, as of

We cast anchor and landed, leaving our strip in the harbour, with Scyn-

meadow full of flowers, we met the guardians of the isse, who immediately

drawn, and abounds in fanciful and piCturesque imagery, interspersed with strokes of humour
and satire. The second book is, indeed, throughout, more entertaining, and better written
