thousand lines does it eost him to describe Vologesus's breoehes, and his
horse’s bridle, and how Osroe’s hair looked when he swam over the Tigris,
what sort osa cave he fied into, and how it was shaded all over with ivy,
and myrtle, and laurel, twined together: you plainly see how necessary this
was to the history, and that we could not poffibly have understood what was
going forward without it.

From inability, and ignorance of every thing useful, these men are driven
to descriptions of countries and caverns, and when they come into a multi-
plicity of great and momentous affairs, are utterly at a loss; like a servant
enriched on a sudden by coming into his master’s estate, who does not
know how to put on his cloaths, or to eat as he should do; but when fine
birds, fat sows, and hares are placed before him, falls to and eats till hc
bursts, of salt meat, and pottage. The writer, ljust now mentioned, de-
scribes the strangest wounds, and the most extraordinary deaths you ever
heard of; tells us of a man’s being wounded in the great toe, and expiring
immediately3 and how on Priscus, the general, bawling out loud, seven and
twenty of the enemy fell down dead upon the spot. He has told lies, more-
over, about the number of the ssain, in contradiction to the account given in
by the leaders : he' will have it that seventy thousand two hundred and thirty-
fix of the enemy died at Europus, and of the Romans only two, and nine
wounded. Surely nobody in their senses ean bear this.

Another thing should be mentioned here also, which is no little fault:
from the affectation of Atticism, and a more than ordinary attention to pu·-
rity of dietion, he has taken the liberty to turn the Roman names into
Greek, to cal-l Saturninus, Κξσυιος, Chronius·, Fronto, Φξοντις, Fronti53 Ti-
tianus, Τιτανιος, Titanius, and others still more ridiculous. With regard to
the death of Severian, he informs us, that every body else was mistaken,
when they imagined that he perished by the sword, for that the man starved
himself to death, as he thought that the eafiest way of dying; not knowing
(which was the case), that he could only have fasted three days, whereas
many have lived without food for seven: unless we are to suppose that
Osroes stood waiting till Severian had starved himself completely, and for
that reason he would not live out the whole week.

But in what class, my dear Philo, shall we rank those historians who are
perpetually making use of poetical expreffions‚ such as “ the engine crush’d,

the wall thunder'd,’' and in another place, ff Edeffa resounded with the
