TRITON.

Ι will tell you the whole affair: the king had sent him against the Gor-
gonS, and when he came to Lybia ---

IPHIANASSA.

How, Triton? Came he alone, or with affistance? for it was a difficule

journey. T R 1 T o N.

He came through the air; Minerva lent him wings. XVhen he arrived
at the place, finding them, I suppose, asseep, he cut off Medusa’s head,

and flew away.

But how could he see to do it? for whoever looks at them is immediately

struck blind.

Minerva lent him her shield (for I heard him tell the story to Andromeda,
and afterwards to Cepheus), and in that he saw the image of Medusa re·
fleeted, asin a looking-glass; then, taking hold of her hair with his lest
hand, and looking at the image, with the sword in his right, cut off her
head, and, before her fisters awoke, fiew off. After which, coming to-
wards AEthiopia‚ and fiying nearer to the earth, he saw the beautiful
Andromache, chained to a rock, her hair dishevelled, and naked almost
to the waist: at first he only pitied her unhappy fate, and asked the cause
of it, but, soon after, falling violently in love with her (for it was decreed
she should be saved), resolved to deliver her3 and when the dreadful mon·
ster came to devour her, the youth, lifting himself up in the air, with one
hand held his sword, and struck him, and with the other shewed him the
Gorgon’s head, which immediately converted him into stone. At fight of
Medusa all his limbs grew stiff, and he died. Perseus then loosened the
virgin’s chains, and led her down, trembling, and on tip-toe from the ssippery
rock. She is now celebrating her nuptials in the palace of Cepheus, and
from thence he carries her to Argos. Thus instead of death has she met
with happiness and a husband.

NEREID.

1 am not sorry for it; for what injury had the virgin done us? though her
mother was so vain-glorious, and pretended to be handsomer than ourselves.
