viii Ox THE LIFE AND

think you of the θ’θ’· Ιίξωτες, which you cannot deny being

the author of?

There, indeed, Istand self-CO11vi&ed: but the age I
lived in, and the manners of those licentious timeS‚ must
mitigate my crime. The subjecit of that little tra& was
then as common a topic of discourse, and thought as in·-
nocent a one as it has since been, and, perhapS, to this
day is, in modern Italy : but this, your lordship will say,
is a poor plea in my favour.

But an indifferent one, indeed: the groffness and obf-
scenity, so often to be met with, not only in your worKs,
but in many other ancient authorS‚ is to me the more ex-
traordinary, as, whenever you chuse to throw a veil over
ideas of the looser kind, (instances of·which might be
given in the pieee I just now mentioned,) you do it in a
manner more elegant than we generally find amongst the
chastes writers of modern ages: how it has happened, I
know not3 but we are certainly much more nice in this
point than you used to be.

Which, by the by, my lord, is no irrefragable proof
that ynu are a whit more virtuous 3 for, as our friend Vol-
taire has prettily observem “ la pudeur S'est enfuie des
Coeurs, et s'est refugiee sur les levres :⁹³ he adds alst), which,
l think, is going too far, in still stronger terrm, and less to
your credit, that “ plus les Moeurs sont deprave5‚ plus les
expressions deviennent mes urees 3 011 croit regagner en lan·
gage cc qu'on a perdu en vertu.''
