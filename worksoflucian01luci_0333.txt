ONDEPENDANTS. 297

eafily be diffuaded by me: if such do not leave their masters after the worst
treatment, they are not worthy of reprehenlion ; they are fit for, and deserve
the usage which they generally meet with; they have no other way os em-
ploying themselveS, and if you take this business from them, they must' re-
main idle, listless, and superfluous members of society : nor do I think such
creatores suffer any thing degrading to them, nor are their masters barbarous
or tyranical : it is only putting the veffel, as we say, to its κ proper use:
for this they entered into the service; and to bear every indignity is their
calling and profeflion. But with regard to those whom Ifirst mentioned, the
men of liberal education‚ Icannot behold it without indignation, nor help
endeavouring, if poffible, to regain their liberty.

lt may not be improper, therefore, previoussy to confidet the causes gene-
rally affigned for embracing this course of life, and to ssiew that they are nei-
ther cogent nor satisfaetory ε this will at once destroy their first great argu-
ment in favour of voluntary servitude. Most men plead poverty, and the
want of neceffaries, as a specious reason for thus flying to shelter from them,
and think it a sufficient excuse to say, that they endeavour to avoid penury,
which of all things is the most oppreflive: then comes in Theognis ro back
them, who is always ready with his,

To which they will add all the terrible things that lazy poets have said about
indigence. 1f1 could perceive that their poverty was in reality removed by

, these means, Ι would not have the least dispute with them concerning liberty:

but fince, as a famous ‡orator says, their food is only like a fick man’s
diet, and they remain still in the same state, will it not follow, that they are
sadly mistaken ? For penury still accompanies them ·, they are always receiv-
ing, and yet never lay by any thing, but, let what will be given, expend
every sarthing on theirimmediate exigencies. Surely it would better have
become them to find out the meanS, not of thus prolonging poverty, by mere

“ Itsproper usin] Greek, ες την οἶμιδα suaper-req, fi in matulam immingant: this explains the
matter to the learned reader, the unlearned may easily guess the meaning, or, if he pleases,
get it construed for him.

† <she man, δικ] The verses on poverty, by Theognis, from which this is quoted, are still
extant, and inserted in the notes in the original; but contain only a few common-place observa-
tions, not worthy of much attention. Lucian, indeed, seems to have treated them as such, and
only quotes to ridicule thern.
