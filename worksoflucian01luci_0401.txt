some things, from their knowledge of other things, which they are not
yet agreed about: they put light and darkness together3 compare things
which differ widely from each other3 and then call it demonstration : prove,
for instance, that because these are altarS, there must of neceffity be gods.
Thus, running as it were in a circle, they return always to the place they set
out at, and wander still in doubt and uncertainty.

How you treat me, Lycinus, by thus reducing all my treasure to a cinder!

my labour, it seems, is vain, and so many years consumed for nothing.

It may be some comfort to you, however, to refleft, that it is not yourself
alone who has been thus disappointed, but that all the philosophers in the
world are fighting, as one may say, for the a· ass's shadow. For who can
go through all? this, you acknowledge, is impoffible. A man may as well
repine, and quarrel with fortune, because he cannot get up into heaven; fink
under the waves of the sea in Sicily, and rise up at Cyprus; or fly from
Greece to lndia z when the cause of his grief, is only because he flattered him-
self with the hopes of all this3 or dreamed of it, or fancied it in his own
mind: not confidering beforehand, whether his hopes were fixed on what
was attainable, or agreeable to the condition of human nature. Reason‚ my
friend, has waked you out of your pleafing dream, and now you are angry
with her: the vifion is so delightful, that you are loath to open your eyes.
And this is the case with all those, who form in their own imaginations an
issand of the blest3 whilst they are digging up hidden riches, and enjoying

him to go on, when he told them the following story: Two men, said he, were travelling to-
gether, one purchased of the other an ass 3 they jogged on, the heat of the weather was intense ;
the ass’s body threw a {hade on the ground, they wanted both to lye down under it3 on this a
quarrel ensued: the man who had sold the beast, said, he did not sell the shade; the other infisted
that he purchased every thing the ass could give, and consequently the shade of it. Here De.
mosthenes stopped: the hearers defired to know the iffue of the dispute3 and how it was deter-
mined. You are mighty eager, said Demosthenes, to hear any thing about the sslade of an ass,
and yet will not listen to me when 1 arn to speak on the important concerns ofthe cornmonwealth.

The ass's ssiadow became afterwards a proverbial expression, to fignisy, like the lana caprina,

any dispute about trifles. See Plutarch.
