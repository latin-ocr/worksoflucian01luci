HERMOTlMUS. 33⁷

HERMOTIMUS.

‚Butl am not talking to the blind, neither do 1 trouble myself about

them.
L Y C 1 N U S.

Surely, my good friend, in things of such consequence, so useful and
necessary to all, there should be some common, some universal mark to dis-

tinguish by: let the blind, if you please‚ go without philosophy, as they
can see nothing; though I should think a little philosophy very neceffary for
them, that they may bear their missortune the better3 but how can those
who do see, be their eyes ever so sharp, behold any thing belonging to the
mind, or judge of it from external appearance? for, let me ask you, did
you not attach yourself to these men from an opinion of their understanding,
and the hopes of improving by their advice?

HERMOTIMUS.

Most undoubtedly. L Y C I N U S

And how, by any of the signs you mentioned, could you tell whether a
man was a good or bad philosopher? this does not appear at first fight, but
lies hidden in secret, and is brought forth only in length of time by fre-
quent meeting, conversation, and other means of thelike nature. You have
heard, Isuppose‚ the story of Momus and Vulcan; if you have not, thus
it runs. .

There was once a trial of sstill, says the fable, between Minerva, Nep-
tune, and Vulcan, which should produce the most complete work: Nep-
tune made a bull, Minerva a horse, and Vulcan a man. When they carne
to Momus, whom they had chosen umpire, after a careful examination of
every performance, he found great fault with Vulcan (what he said of the
rest it matters not), for not making a ἢ door in his man’s breast, to open
and let us know what he willed, and thought, and whether he spoke truth
or not.

Momus was so dull he could not see into these things; but you, with
more than the lynx’s sharpness, can see into the breast of every man, and not

only can tell what he wius, and what he thinks, but whether he is better
or worse than any body else. ’

* A door, ἐξα] Plato mentions this fable.—Momus’s window is an excellent thought, and
might furniffl some hints for a good periodical paper-
