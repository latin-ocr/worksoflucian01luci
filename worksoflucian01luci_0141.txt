True: but mortals are all insolent; and when he returns to earth, per-

haps he will boast of his: success with Jun0, and that he has rivalled Jove;

know it was only a cloud, will very poffibly believe.

MERCURY Auo THE SUN-

M E R C U R Y.

SUN, by command of Jupiter, you are not to drive your chariot to-day‚
nor to-mori'ow,⁴ nor the day after, but stay within3 and, in the mean time,
let it be one continual night; therefore let your Hours take off the horses,
and do you put out your fise, and be quiet for some time.

S U N.
Mercury, this is most strange and surprifing news you bring3 have I done
arniss, or gone out of the way, that he is angry with me, and has determined
to make the night three times lon-„er than the day ?

M E R C U R Y.
No such thing3 nor is it to be always so ; but he has a particular occafion
for a longer night than ordinary.
S U N.
And where is he now? and where did you leave him, when you came
with this meffsge to me?

M E R C U R Y.
In Boeotia, with Amphitryon's wife.

SUN.

‚So he is in love with her, and one night is not enough for him.
