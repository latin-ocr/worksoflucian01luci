336 HERMOTIMus,

talking with another ᾖ Margites, foolissi enough, to believe that a man of
sense, like Hermotimus, at the age of forty, would have trusted a matter
so important as philosophy to a parcel of ideots, who knew nothing of the

matter, and determined his choice as they directed him. I would never
believe any body that should tell me so.

'HERMOTIMUS
But you are to know, my friend, I did not rely on others in this affair,

but on myself3 for 1 observed the Stoics always of a decent carriage, always
well and properly cloathed, always serious and thoughtful, with a manly
aspe&, generally close-ssiaved, neither soft and effeminate, nor too rough
and negligent in their appearance, as the Cynics are, but preserving in all
things that medium which Is universally admired.

And did you never see them do any of those things, which, as I just now
observed, your master was guilty of, suc-h as turning usurers, scolding people
for their wages, quarrelling art their meetings, and the like? or do you
think all this fignifies nothing, provided that their dress is becoming, their
beards long, and their heads close-shaved? Upon the whole then, from this
wise decifion, we learn this excellent sule, that we are tojudge of merit by
habits, beards, and gestures3 and whoever excels not in these, and does
not look fierce, thoughtful, and morose, should be reprobated and despised.
But do you really think, HermotimUS, Ι am to be so easily fooled and im-

posedon? Α
HERMOTIMUS.

Dress, my good friend, is the excellence of a statue3 they are much

⁰³( better cloathed, and appear finer when a Phidias, a Myro, or Alca-
menes trick them out to the best advantage3 but, if we must judgc from

these marks, what must the seeker after true philosophy do, who happens
to be blind, how will he distinguish which se& is the best, who cannot see ⁷
how they dress, or how they walk?

ἃ Margfrcs] Any foolish fellow was commonly called Margite3‚ probably from some famous
ideot of that name. sec Erasm. Chil. According to Aristode, Homer wrote a mock-
heroic, or satit-{cal poem with this title, though it is disputed by other writers.

ἦ· Revera-lomna] Most os the best ancient statues, now extant, are naked.—Thc well-
dressed oneS‚ which Lucian talks of, have not had the good fortune to reach us. ⁷
