422 THE*TRUEHISTORY.'

‘lumn of tumber, in the midst of the air, and on the borders of the two king·
dorus, This treaty was sworn to, on the partos the Heliots, by ΞΕ Pyroni-
des, and Therites, and Phlogius3 and on the part of the Selenites, by Nyc-
tor‚ and MeniuS, and Polylampus.’'

Such was the peace made between them : the wall was immediately pulled
down, and we were set at liberty. When we returned to the moon, our
companions met and embraced m, shedding tears of joy, as did Endymion
also. He intreated us to remain there, or to go along with the new colony,
promifing to give me his son in marriage, for they have no women there; this
1 could by no means be persuaded το, but begged he would let us down into
the sea. As he found I could not be prevailed on to stay, after feasting us
most nobly for seven days, he dismissed us.

1 will now tell you every thing which Ι met with in the Moon, that was
new and extraordinary. In the first place, they never 'breed there from wo-
men, but from men ; they always marry males, and do not so much as know
the name of woman ; the men are wives till five and twenty, and then marry
themselves. The foetus is borne not in the womb‚ but in the calf of the
leg; and when the embryo is conceived, the calf swells; it appears dead
when it first comes out, but they breathe upon it in the open air, and it vi·-
-vifies : for this reason, I suppose, we call this part in Greek ἢν Gastronymia,
because, amongst these people it bears the foetus instead of the belly‚ But
what I am going to tell you, is still more wonderful, There is a race of
men amongst them, whom they call Dendritae, and which are produced in
this manner: they plant the right testicle of a man into the ground, from
whence springs up a large tree, fleshy, and like a phallus, with leaves, and
branche33 its fruit is an acorn about a cubit long3 when this is ripe, they
gather it, and out of it comes a man ᾗ, * ‘³⁶ ἴθ’ 5⁵ '3 ‘r '⁴²² ²²4 ⁶³ss ’ὅ

Amongst them, when a man grows old, he does not die, but dissolves
into sinoak, and turns to air, They all eat the same food, which is, frogs
roasted on the ashes from a large fire; of these they have plenty which fly

Wherever you meet with these Shandean marks, or asterisms *‚ you mayconclude‚ that Lu,
