long out of heaven: ther. may Iturn cup-bearet, and hop about for the
entertainmcnt of the company.

And would you let me come up here tor nothing; a friend too, a brother
sailor, and collegue, as you are? ln good truth, son of Maia, you ought
to remember thatI never made you labour at the oar, or set you to steer
the boat; you lay, stretched out at your ease, at the stern, with those
broad shoulders of yours, or, perhaps, if you lit on some g‹›ffiping ghost,
kept prating with him all the way: whilst l, a poor old feIlow, was left to
tug you over by myself. Ibeseech you, therefore, by your honoured fa-
ther, my dear little Mercury, do not desert me, but lead me through life,
and let me say, when 1 go back, that I have seen something: if you leave
me, Ι shall be like the blind3 as they totter about and stumble in the dark,

so {hall I in the light: grant me this favour, then, good Cyllenius, and Ι
will for ever acknowlege it.

This affair will certainly eost me some blows3 my circumambulation wi11
be rewarded with a few stripes : however, I must consent3 what can one do,
when a friend infists upon it? but as to seeing every thing, and completely
too, my good ferryman‚ it is impoffible3 that would be a work of years:
Jupiter, then, would have me cried as a runaway; besides, that it would
put a stop to all your business below: if you left off transporting the dead
for such alength of time, it would be very prejudicial to Pluto’s empire,
and AEacus would be in a rage, when not a farthing came into his cof·
fers; but I must endeavour to fhew you at least the heads of things as well x

asIcan.
C H A R Ο Ν.

Ileave you to judge in what manner we strall proceed; for, as to myself,
being a stranger in these parts, I' know nothing of the matter.
ΔΜ Ε R C U R Y.
In the first place, then, Charon, we must find out some eminence‚ from
which we may view every thing. If you could have gone up to heaven,

Tost all the day, in rapid circles round,
Nor, till the sun descended‚ touch'd the ground;
Breathless Ι fell. in giddy motion lost,
The Sinthians rais’d me on the Lemnian coast.
See Pope, book i. 1. 760.
