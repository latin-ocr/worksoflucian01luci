brought to him; for the horse was killed with him, both of then] being run
through by an armed Thracian, in the battle with the king of the Cappado-
cians, at the river Araxes. Arsaces, as he told us himself, ,rnshing with
great rapidity against the enemy, had got a long way before his troops,

Piraeus, Lampis, the Acharnensmn general of the allies, and Damis, the
rich Corinthiun. The flatterer was poisoned by his own son, and the former
killed himself for the love of Myrtinm the harlot. Blepszas, it was reported, ”
