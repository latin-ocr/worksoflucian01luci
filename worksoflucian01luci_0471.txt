TnETRUEI-IISTORY. 435

day, but a perpetual twilight3 one equal season reigns throughout the year,
itis always spring with them, and no wind blozvs but Zephyrus,· the whole
region abounds in sweet flowers, and shrubs of every kind ; their vines bear
twelve times in the year, yielding fruit every month, their apples, pome-
granates, and the rest of our autumnal produce, thirteen times, bearing
twice in the month of Minos ε instead of corn, the fields bring forth loaves
of ready-made bread, like mushrooms: there are three hundred and sixty—
five fountains of water round the city, as many of honey.. and five hundred,
rather smaller, os sweet-scented oil, besides seven rivers of milk, and eight
of wine.

Their Sympofia are held in a place without the city, which they call t'ne
Elysian Field3 this is a most beautiful meadow, skirted by a large and thick
Avood, affording an agreeable {hade to the guests, who repose on couches of
flowers; the winds attend upon, and bring them every thing necessary, ex-
cept wine, which is otherwise provided, for there are large trees on every
fide, made of the finest glass, the fruit of which are cups of various shapes
and fizes; whoever comes to the entertainment gathers one or more of these
cups, which immediately becomes full of wine, and so they drink of it,
whilst the nightingales, and other birds of song, with their bills peck the
flowers out of the neighbouring fields, and drop them on their heads; thus
are they crowned with perpetual garlands: their manner of perfnming them
is this; the clouds suck up the scented oils from the sountains and rivers,
and the winds gently fanning them, distil it like soft dew on those who are
affembled there; at supper they have mufic als0, and finging, particularly
the verses of Homer, who is himself generally at the feast, and fits next

above Ulyffes‚ with a chorus of youths and virgins: he is led in, accom-
panied by ³⁵ Eunomus the Locrian, Arion of Lesbos, Anacreon, and † Ste.

fichorus, whom I saw there along with them, and who at length is recon-
ciled to Helen: when they have finished their songS, another chorus begins

ἅ Eunomus-'j A famous mufician. Clemens Alexandrinus gives us a full account of him,
to whom l refer the curious reader-

† Stqfichorun] This poet, we are told, wrote some severe verses on Helen, for which he
was punished by Castor and Pollux with loss of fight; but on making his recantation in a pali-
nodia, his eyes were gracioussy restored to him. Lucian has affronted her still more grossy, by
making her run away with Cinyrus; buthe, we are to suppose, being not over superstitious,
defied the power of Castor and Pollux.
