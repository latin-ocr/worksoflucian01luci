HALCYON. ⁵5

What changes, both of mind and body, happen in the space of a few years!
How superior are men to children ! Insomuch that one may with ease destroy

a thousand: infancy is, by the law of nature, weak and destitute of all
thingS. If man thus differs from man, what must be the infinite distance

between us and heaven! Doubtless as much as the whole world is greater
than Socrates or Chaerephon‚ so much must the divine Power and Intellee‘l:
exceed our weak and limited capacities.
Things, moreover, which you and 1, and many more like ourselves, think
imprac‘ticable, others will perform with ease: playing on the flute‚ to those
who have never learned ; writing, or reading, to the ignorant and illite1·ate; is,
perhaps, as difficult as to make women out of birds, or birds out of women.
Nature finds a creature dropped in the hive, without feet or wings, she adds
both, adorns it with a variety of beautiful colours, and produces the wife and
provident bee, the artificer of divine honey: from the dumb and lifeless egg
ihe brings forth a thousand different species of birds, aquatic and terrestrial, by
the affistance, and under the direction of the supreme Will.

Since, therefore, so great is the power of the gods, and we weak mortals
are neither able to dive into deep myster-ies, nor even to judge as we ought
of the little things around us, let us not pretend to determine any thing con-
cerning Halcyons or 3‘· nightingales. For my own part, as Ι received the tra-
dition from my forefathers, I will deliver it to my children: thy hymns,
melodious mourner, willI ever remember, and celebrate thy pious conjug-al
affection, telling thy tale to my wives † Myrto and Xantippe‚ not forgetting
the honour which thou hast received from the gods: thou, Chaerephon, J

hope, wilt do the same. -

That you may be ass'ured Iwill: for what you have rcmarkcd may be
profitable both to husbands and wives.

Salute Halcyone, then, and let us away to the city.

⁸ Nightingales‚] Alluding to the story of Philomela.

† Myrto and Xantip e‚] Lucian here informs us that Socrates had two wives, and Plutarch
(see his life of Aristides, is ofthe same opinion. Plato and Xenophon, however, give him but
one, Xantippe3 who. according to all accounts, was full enough, if not rather too much for

him. This question is discussed by Bentley, in his Differtation on the Epissles of Phalaris, to
which Irefer the curicus reader.
