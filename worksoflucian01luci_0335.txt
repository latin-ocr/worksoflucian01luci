ONDEPENDANTS. 299

lest despair should entirely damp his ardour‚ and put an end to the attach-
ment: they smile, therefore, and promise, and are always about to do some·
thing very great3 age in the mean time creeps on, and both grow too old
either to impart happiness or to receive it; and thus life is spent in nothing
but vain hope, and fruitless expeffihtion. η

For those, however, who are so fond of pleasure, that they will go through
every thing in pursuit of it, it may not be altogether so reprehensrble if they
submit to some indignities, though, at the same time, it is mean and base
to sell themselves sor it, as the pleasure which liberty bestows is infinitely
superior to every other. It may be pardonable, notwithstanding, if, after
all, they can really get pofl'effion of it: but, for the mere hope of this bles-
fing, to suffer so much, is surely the height of madness and folly. The
difficulties which they have to struggle through, they must perceive‚ are
manifest and unavoidable3 and what they hoped for, never yet has, nor,
probably, ever may come to pass. The companions of Ulyffes, when they
had tasted the sweet ἥ lotus, thought of nothing else, and negledstd all that
was right and good. Their negligence, perhaps, engaged as they were in
that delightful employment, might in some measure be excuseable3 but
for a famished wretch to stand perpetually by another devouring lotuS, and
yet never offering him any, only with the distant hope, that in time he may
chance to taste of it; in the mean while, forgetting every thing that is good
and virtuous, is surely most truly ridiculous, and worthy of Homeric stridore.

For this, or something like this, itis that so many give themselves up to
the rich and great, to be treated as they think proper. Some, indeed,
whom, perhaps, you will say, I ffiould have mentioned, do it merely for
the honour and glory of keeping company with the rich, the noble, and the

well-drefl'ed: there are, who imagine this denotes something grand, and
above the vulgar cast3 though, for my own part, I would not associate with

a king, merely because he was so, unless some advantage resulted to me
frorn it.
