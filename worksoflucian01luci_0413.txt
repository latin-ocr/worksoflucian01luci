HERODOTUS. 377

tinguished him, they pointed him out, and cried, ἥ that is he, that is He-
rodotus, who wrote our battles with the Perfians‚ in the Ionic dialect, and
celebrated our victories in his divine songs. Thus did he reap the fruits of
his conquest, the universal suffrage of admiring Greece, and his triumph was
adorned, not by one herald, but by every city whose inhabitants had been
eye-witneffes of that magnificent spectaclc. In this, nearest path to fame
and honour, he was afterwards followed by Hippias the Sop hist, Prodicus,
Anaximenes, Polus of Agrigentum, and many others, who repeated their
works before the general affembly, and became, in a short time, universally
celebrated and admired.

But why needl mention ancient orators, sophists, and historians, when
a recent example is before υς, of AEtion the painter, who so lately produced
his pid‘ture of Alexander and Roxana, at the same place, and with such suc-
cess, that Proxenidas, the chiefjudge, was so charmed with it, that he
gave him his daughter in marriage.

You will naturally ask what there could be so extraordinary in this pieture,
as to induce the judge to take AEtion, who was a stranger, for his son in
law: itis now in Italy, where I have seen, and am, therefore, able to give
you a full description of it.

The † scene is a handsorne inner chamber, with a nuptial bed in it, on
which Roxana, a most beautiful virgin, is reclining, with her eyes fixed on
the ground, as ashamed of looking up to Alexander, who stands by her.
She is attended by several smiling Cupids, one of whom is behind, lifting up
her veil, and discovering her beauties to the bridegroom ; whilst another, in*
the charaeter of a ssave, pulls off her ssipper, that she may lie down; an·
other lays hold on Alexander’s robe, and seems drawing him, with all his
strength, towards the bride: he hasa garland in his hand, which he offers
her; Hephaestion stands close to him, with a torch in his hand, and leaning

ἦ· Theficne is, &ej The Ρίἇὶυῑε here so accurately described by Lucian, had undoubtedly
no inconfiderable share of merit; a better proof of this cannot be giyen. than that the immortal
Raphael was so struck with it, as to paint one on the same subje6t‚ wherein he adheres closely
in every part to Lucian’s description, except that our author lays his scene in the inner chamber
ofa house, and Raphael in a camp. Raphael's pic'ture made part of the furniture of his own

bed-chamber, and is now at his villa near Rome; there are prints from it, engraved by, and
may be found in Hamilton’s collection of the Italian School. The French painter, Coypel‚
likewise employed his pencil on this story, which he has treated nearly in the sarne manner:

· his print is reckoned a very good one.
