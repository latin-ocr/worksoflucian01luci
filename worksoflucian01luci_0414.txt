33 HERODOTUS.

on a beautiful youth, whoml take to be Hymen, though there is no name

inscribed over him ; in another part of the pisture are a number of Cupids,
sporting with Alexander’s armour, two of them, like portem, sweating un-
dera burthen, carrying his spear, with two more at a little distance, one
lying upon his shield, and borne, like a king in triumph, by several, who
take hold of the handles of it, whilst the other gets into his coat of mail,
Α and conceals himself, as if with a defign to frighten the rest if they come
that way : nor are these sports without defign, as'the artist meant by them
to point out the hero's paffion for war, and to shew that, how much soever

Pisa itself, but from a nobler city3 not the dregs of the populace, not a
croud gathered to a spectacle, and listening to an Herodotus 3v but to a com*-
pany of orators, historians, and sophists of the first rank3 far superior to
any thing at the Olympic games. I cannot compare myself to a Glaucus, a

myself, be intituled to your csteem and approbation.
