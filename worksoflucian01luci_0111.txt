DIALOGUE IX.

VENUSANDCUPID.
V E N U S.

HOW comes it to pasS, Cupid, that whilst you attack Jupiter, Juno,
Neptune, Apollo, nay, and even me, your own mother, and all the gods
and goddesses, Minerva alone escapes you? against her your torch has
no fire·‚ your quiver no arrows: you have neither bow, nor ikill to use

one.
C U P 1 D.

In truth, mother, I am afraid of her3 she is so masculine, so formidable,
and looks so fiercely. Whenever Ι stretch my bow against her, she {hakes her
crested helmet, and so terrifies me, that Ι tremble all over, and my arrows

drop out of my hand.
V E N U S.

Was not Mars much more formidable, and yet, though mmcd, you con*-

quered him?
C U P 1 D.

But he voluntarily yields, and even invites me3 whilst Minerva always
looks sternly on me. Once I flew rashly up, and held my torch close to
her, when immediately she cried out, “ By my father, if you approach a
step nigher to me, I will run you through with this lance, take you by the
foot, and hurl you headlong down to TartarUS, or tear you into a thousand
pieces.'’ Thus did ihc threaten me ε then she looks so sour, and carries on
her breast a frightful Gorgon's head, with snakes round it, which 1 ss1uddcr

at, and run away whenever I see herr

V E N U Sa
So you are afraid of Minerva and her Gorgon, more than of Jove’s thuna
der ε but how happens it that the Muses also are invulnerable by you, and
safe from the power of your darts? Do they shake their crested helmets and

Gorgons too?
C U P 1 D.

Them I revere ε they are always grave, and wrapped in meditation, and in-
tent on sacred song: 1 often stand by and listen to them, delighted with their

melody. v E N U s,

Well, fince they are so reverend, let rhem alone3 but why do not you

attack Diana ?
