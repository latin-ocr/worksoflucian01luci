thus, who was desperately in love, as he observed in his defence3 'ne threw,
himself into the fire with the greatest resolution, though the Crotonians
pitied him, and would have changed his sentence into banishment. Your be-
haviour is certainly more absurd, to abuse, in the manner you did, in a la-
boured speech, the meanness and servility of those who get into great men's
houses, there to suffer so many indignities ; and yet, after this, in the extre-
niity of old age, when you have already almost paffed the usual limits of
human life, to enter into this shameful servitude, and seem, as it were, even
to glory in it. The more celebrated you are, the more ridiculous will men
think you, whilst your present life thus gives the lie to your past professi-005,
But there is no need of fresh accusations against you, after the ³¹⁵ poets ex-
cellent observation, “ Ihate (says he), the wise man, who is not wisc for
himself.’' They will say, rnoreover, perhaps, that you are like the tragedy

or rather tore it off, laid hold on the fruit, and most voracioussy de-

voured it.
“ You, they will say, who are not an atstor, but a profeffor of wisdom, and

alegissator, are but too like the ape with the fig83 you carry your philo-

players, in his Fisherman.

If our players were to be sent in this manner to the house of correction, as often as they aeied
miserably, how few would venture to enroll themselves in his majesty's company ofcomedians!

AEsop's fable of the cat turned intoa woman, and verifies the observation of Horace,
