453 THEDISINHERITED soN..

KVhen I think Ι can be of service, Ι never wait to be sent for, Ι came*
therefore uncalled to his affistance : but where there are no hopes of success
Ι never chuse to a& at all. Vv'ith regard to this woman, I dare not inter-
fere: if 1 had not succeeded‚ what mustl have expeited from him, when Ι
am thus treated, only for not attempting it 1 I am fincerely concerned at the>
disorder of my mother-in-law, because she is a good woman. 1 arn con-
cerned on account of my father, who is truly unhappy about her3 and, above
all, Ι am concerned on my own account, because it appears as if I refused
on purpose, though my reason of prescribing nothing to her is, in reality,
because her distemper is so violent that it is not in the power of art to re=
move it. ’

Ροῇννῇεῖ reasons Ι was first banished is but too apparent from his present>
treatment of me. To his former accusations the life which I afterwards led-
is a sufficient answer, and what he now urges against me will be eafily refuted
by what I am going to mention. I, who was so intractable and refractory ;¹

others were likewise of opinion that the furious threats which<¹ he mter-ed, his>
unreasonable hatred, his bitter reproacheS, his unjust condemnation of me,
were preludes to the ensuing disorder, and marks of future insanity3 and Ιῑ
then thought I should one day stand in need of the· medical art to affist me ins
the cure of it.

countries, and pursuing my studies with indefatigable toil and a‘ffiduity, ar

raving mad, and given over by all our own phyficians, who had not gone
to the bottom of things, nor entered into the nature of diseases- with suffi-
