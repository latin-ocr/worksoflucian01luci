4.·4 THE TRUE H1s‘roRY.

Ctefias, the Cnidiam son of Ctefiochus, wrote an account of India, and
of things there, which he never saw himself, nor heard from any body else.
Iambulus also has acquainted us with many wenders which he met with in
the great sea, and which every body knew to be absolute falsehoods: the
work, however, was not unentertaining. Belides these, many others have
likwise presented us with their own travels and peregrinations, where they
tell us of wondrous large beasts, savage men, and unheard-of ways of living.
The great leader and master of all this rhodomontade is Homer's Ulyffes,
who talks to Alcinous about the 4 winds pent up in bags, man-eaters, and
one-eyed Cyclops, wild men, creatures with many heads, several of his com—
panions turned into beasts by enchantment, and a thousand things of this
kind, which he related to the ignorant and credulous Phaeacians.

These, notwithstanding, 1 cannot think much to blame for their false-
hoods, seeing that the custom has been sometimes authorised, even by the
pretenders to philosophy : Ι only wonder that they should ever expetii: to be
believed: being, however, myselfincited, by aridiculous vanity, with the
delire of transmitting something to posterity, that Ι may not be the only man
who doth not indulge himself in the liberty of frition, asI could not relate
’ any thing true (for Ι know of nothing at present worthy to be recorded), Ι
turned my thoughts towards falsehood, aspecies os it, however, much more
excusable than that of others, as I shall at least say one thing true, when I
tell you that I lye, and shall hope to escape the general censure, by acknow·
leging that Ι mean to speak not a word of truth throughout. Know ye,
therefore, that I am going to write about what Ι never saw myself‚ nor ex-
perienced, ’ nor so much as heard from any body else, and, what is
more, of such things as neither are, nor ever can be. Igive my readers
warning, therefore, not to believe me.

may certainly be numbered, with all due deference to so great a name, amongst the nugae ca-
norae of old Homer. Juvenal certainly confiders them in this light, when he says,

Tam vacui capitis populum Phaeaca putavit.
Some modern critics, however, have endeavoured to defend them.
