CHIRON.

Howso?
MENIPPUS.

Because, if you were so satiated in the other world, by a repetition of the
same enjoyments, you must be satiated here als0, where every thing is alike;
you will therefore be for making another change, and seeking after another
life, which cannot poffibly be granted.

C H I R O N.

What, then, Menippus, is to be done?

M E N 1 P P U S.

What should be done by a man of sense, which, they say, you are, and
which I believe you to be 3 be pleased and satisfied with what you have, and

think nothing either in life or death insupportable.

DIALOGUE XXIX.

DIOGENESANDHERCULES„

D I O G E N E S.
IS not this Hercules? By Hercules it is! his bow, his club, his lion's
sstln, his fize, in short, Hercules all over. Could he die, who was the son
of Jupiter? Pray, inform me, my noble conqueror, are you really dead?

For, upon earth, I saerificed to you as a god.

H E R C U L E S.
And you were right in so doing: for Hercules himself is with the

gods in heaven, and Ι am only his image.

D Ι Ο G E N E S.
How is that? the image of a god Ι and is it poffible for any one to be half

mortal‚ and half immortal?
H E R C U L E S.
Certainly3 for he did not die, but 1, who am his ᾖ image.

ᾗ His image] The ancients imagined that the soul, though freed from the body, had still ‘a
vehicle, exaffly resembling the body3 as the figure in a mould retains the resemblance of the
mould, when separated frorn it: this vehicle was supposed to be less gross than the mortal bo-
dy, and less subtil than the soul; so that whatever wounds the outward body received, when
living, were believed to affe& this inward substance, and, consequendy, might be vifible after
separation: this is the strange and unintelligible notion which Lucian ridicules in the dialogue
before us, as well as in many other parts of his works.
