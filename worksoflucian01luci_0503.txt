Tar-:DISINHERITED SON. 467

is he is a smith, work me this thing, and not that: must the son be banissi·
ed for not doing as his father bade him? by no means, 1 should imagine.
But the art of medicine is still nobler and more useful, and should doubtless
be more free also, with regard to the profess‘ors of it. This, above all, should
have its own just prerogative 3 a thing so sacred, the gift of heaven, bestow—
ed by the gods; the study of the wisest of men is not to be forced, is not to
be commanded; not subjeEted to the ssavery of the laws, to sear or punish—
ment, to the suffrage ofjudges, to the threats of a father, or to the anger
and resentment of the unsseilful and illiterate: insomuch, that 1 would open·
ly and boldly say to you, “ 1 will not a& ς 1 do not like it ς l will keep my
art for myself and my father alone; sor others 1 chuse to know nothing.''
What tyrant is there so arbitrary as to force any man to exercise his art whe-
ther he will or not? Such things are to be obtained, not by laws, not by rc-
sentment, not by courts ofj udicature, but by prayers and supplications: the
phyfician must bc overcome, not by command, but by persuasion ε he may be
prevailed on, but he will not be tcrrified, hc will not be compellcd to give
his affistance, but will come with pleasure os his own accord. This art
should be free from paternal authority, seeing that every city bestows on phy·
ficians many public honours, immunitieS, prerogatives, and precedency.
ThisI might have urged in defence ofmy art, even if you had taken care
to teach it me, and had paid for my learning it, and 1 had refused to under-
take this cure alone, when it was in my power. But only refle& within
yourself‚ how unreasonable it is to forbid my making use of that which is
my own. 1 learned this art when 1 was no longer your son, nor subjc& to
your commandS, yet for your sake 1 learned it: you received the first fruits
of it, though Ihad no support or affistance from you : what masscr did you
hire for me? what medicines did you pay for? none at ail. 1 was poor and
destitute, and the masters instruCted mc out of charity. All that my father
provided me with, was poverty, solitude, and wrerchcdness, the hatred of
all my family, the disgust and contempt os all my relations: in return for
this, you expe& that 1 should praclisc my art3 you would be lord of all those
things which 1 was supplied with; you, who have no right to be master of
them, rest satisfied, that Idid you a favour when 1 had no obligations to you,
and which you could have no right or title to: nor would it be just, that my
former kindness should lay me under the neceffity of conferring future bene-

fits on you, or becausel was willing to affist you then, 1 should be forced to
