And was not Cario right in pulling you by the nose, such a tyrant as you

have been ? but you shall now have a better kingdom, and taste of the club.
MEGAPENTHES.

Shall Cyniscus dare to list up his stick against me? When thou wert bold

and impudent, ssave, and offered to find fault with me, was Ι not near beat·

ing thee to death?

And for that very reason you 111311 now be tied to the mast.

Pray, Clotho, why must Ι be treated so contemptuoussy? because Ι am

poor 1 must come aboard last.

CLOTHO.

Whoareyou?

And are you sorry to be detained from us, whilst the tyrant, here, makes
such liberal promises, if we will but spare him ever so short a time? 1 won-
der the delay is not more grateful to you.

But, my dear good Fate‚ attend a little: 1 never admired that Cyclop’s
generofity, who promised ‘⁴⁵ Outis, 116 should be the last devoured3 for first
or last, the same teeth must make an end of him. Befides, we differ great-

tyrant, whilst he lived, seemed happy, the dread and the admiration of all ;
but, when deprived of his treasures, his fine cloaths, his sumptuous enter-
tainments‚ 'his horses, and his beauteous concubines, had reason to com-

them. The foul, lknow not how, sticks like bird-lime to these things,

and cannot easily part with what it took so much delight in ε the chain that
binds them together is not to be broken : if they are separated by violence,

the sufferes will cry out in agonies, and, brave as men may be in other things,

ἃ Outis.] Alluding to that pafflage in the ninth book of Homer’s Odyssey, where Ulyss‘es calls
himself Οντις, Nobody, and Polyphemus tells him,

When all thy wretched crew have felt my pow’r,
No man shall be the last I will devour.
