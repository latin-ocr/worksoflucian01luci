THE

T v R A N T,

ADIALOGUE.

In this Dialogue, which is one of Luc1AN’s best, the Cruelty‚ Extravagance, and'
Insenfibility of the Rich and Great, with their fond Attachment to sze, and all
its Follies‚ are painted in the liveliest colours. The Charatffiers of MlcYLLUs
is afine Contrcst to MEGAPENTHES. His Burlesque of the Urant's Lamenta-
ti0n‚ peffbniffi'ing the Bed and Lamp, and bringing them in as Evidence, with
fiveral other Strokes of Humour, must divert the mest phlegmatic Reader. This
Dialogue is likewise called Καταπλες, ον THE PAssAGE (from one World to the
other), but, as the TYRANT is the principal Personage concerned, and one fille·
isfifficient‚ Ι thought it mcst proper t'o retain that only.

ELL, say no more, Clotho, for my boat is ready to put off, the·

. pump is clean, the mast raised, the sails spread, the oars all hang

in their proper places, and nothing, as far as Ι am concerned‚ prevents our
weighing anchor immediately: b-ut Mercury is tardy‚ who ought to have
been here long ago. There are no paffengers, you see: by this time we-
might have been thrice over and back again. It is almost dark already,
and not a farthing have I taken yet. Pluto, 1 know, will think it is owing
to my neglect, when somebody else is in fault: but this excellent conductor
of the dead having tasted, I suppose, some Lethean water above, the same
as we drink here below, has forgot to come back to us: he is wrestling with
tlte boys, playiug on his pipe, teaching rhetoric, ssiewing some ofhis tricks,
or, perhapS, pilferfflg, for that is one of the arts hc profeffe53 and this is
the reason why he thus plays loose with us3 though he is, properly speak-

ing, at least =·.÷ half our own. C

ᾗ Ηαξΐαιιν θεωμ] Charon seems to have had a fair right to call him so, as half Mercury’e bu-
siness was to concinet the shades to hell and back again, and carry on the intercourse between Ju-
piter and Pluto: in consequence of which there are figures of him, representing his face half
