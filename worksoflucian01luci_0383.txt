HE'RMOTIMUS.
Thus, my friend, if we find our cup amongst the Stoics, we need not
strip any body else ; we have what we were in search of, and why should we
take any more trouble about it ?

But, after all, my friend, if you do find the thing, you ean never be cer·

tain that it is the very thing you were in search of. The corriparison will not
hold good3 for first, it is not, in this case, only two who g.» into the temple,
one of whom must have it, but a great many3 then, again, „ve are not quite
clear what the thing is, whether it be a cup, a phial, or a garland; fot·
some of the priests call it one thing, and some another, nor are they agreed
even about what it is made of: one calls it brass, another fila-er, another
gold, and another tin: all, therefore, who go in must be stripped, if you
expe& to meet with what you are in search of: even if you find a gold phial
upon one, still you must examine the rest.

Because it is not certain whether it was a phial, that they lost, or some-
thing else3 and even, if this is determined, it is not yet agreed upon, that
the phial was a gold one3 nay, after all, if this was settled, and you, should
find a gold phial, still there is a neceflity of searching the rest; you could
not be sure this belonged to the temple3 for, may there not be more golden ,

phials than one?

Certainly. L Y C I N U S

All, therefore, must be examined, and what is found upon each fairly
produced, that so we may determine which is the very thing that was stolen
out of the temple. XVhat makes the affair still more perplexing is, that upon
every one who is stripped may be found something; a first shall have a cup,
a second a phial, a third a crown3 one shall be of brass, another, perhaps,
of gold, and another of filver3 but whether either of them is the sacred one
does not appear: ’you are still, therefore, at a loss for the thief, -and is they
sound all alike, you could not guess which had stolen that very thing; for
they might all be private property ε the principal cause of all this uncer-
tainty is, that the cup which is lost has no inscription on it; for if it had the
name of the deity, or of the giver upon it, we should be at little trouble,
