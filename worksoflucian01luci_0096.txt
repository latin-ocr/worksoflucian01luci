did 1 imagine Jupiter would have thought of it the next day, or deemed it
so ‹rtievous an injury, that the distributor should play this little trick, and
givbe himself the better portion. But even suppose 1 had not given him the
smaller part, but taken away the whole, where would have been the great
crime; for this, is heaven and earth, as the proverb says, to be moved?
Are chains, croffeS, and lancets to be called in, eagles to be sent down, and
my liver to be devoured? Is not this only to expose his own levity and
meanness? Is he was so angry at being deprived of a few bits of flesh,
what would he have said if he had lost the whole ox ? How much more
reasonable are men in things of this kind, who yet, we may suppose, must
be much more prone to anger than the gods Ξ None of them would hang up
a cook for dipping his fingers in, and tasting the broth, or touching a bit
of roast-meat, but would undoubtedly forgive him·, they might, perhaps,
be angry with the man, give him a ssap on the face, or thresh him; they
would not, however, for such a crime send him to the gallows. But on
this point Ι have said enough ε I blush even for the defenee, on such a sub-
jeC't, much more should you for the accusation.

And now for the crime alleged of, making men ε which, as it seems to
divide itself into two heads, I am at a loss which I am to be most blamed f0r;
whetherI ought not to have made thern at all, and, in that case, the earth
had remained totally rude and uncultivated 3 or whether I should have made
thern in a different manner. 1 shall [peak to both points3 and first, there-
fore, Issian endeavour to shew, that the gods could suffer no injury from the
formation of man3 and next, that so far from it, it was much better, and
more profitable for them, that the earth should not be without men.

ln the beginning, then, (for by this it will best appear whether I was
to blame for creating man) there were nothing but gods: the earth was
rude, and without form, full of woods, briars, and thorns ε there were no
altars or temples, (how indeed should there be Ρ) nor images, nor statues of
the gods, made with eare and elegance, as they now are, nor any thing of
that kind : when I, who am always thinking of something for the com-
mon good, began to confidet with myself what I could do to promote the
honour of the gods, and concluded that the best method was to take a small
portion of clay, and make some creatures like ourselves z as thinking that
the divine nature wanted something, not having its oppofite, by a com-

parison with which it would appear more perfect, and more happy. Mortal,
therefore,
