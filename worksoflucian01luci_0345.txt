quor, of how little consequence you are in such company3 but even of this
stuff you are not at liberty to drink as much as you please; for it often hap-
pens that when you call for it, the * boy will pretend he never heard you.
This, and more than this, every thing, in short, must hurt you; but,
above all, when the fiddler, the dancing master, and the little Alexandrian
with his love-song5‚ is preferred before you; for you rnust never expe& to be -
held in equal esteem with these tempting minions : you have nothing to do,
therefore, but to hide yourself in a corner, lament your fate, and accuse
, cruel fortune for denying you such allurements. How you wish now that
you were a writer of love verses, or even that you could fing those of others,
when you see how much these talents are prized l you might stand your
ground if you were only a conjurer‚ or fortune-teller, who promises estates,
riches, and empires: for these you see are admitted into the friendsnip of
the great, and rewarded with honours and dignities; but for all this you
are totally unqualified ε you rnust of neceffity‚ therefore, be degraded, and
weep your wretched condition in filence and sorrow. If it should be whis-
pered that you are the only one who did not join in applauding your mistress’
finger, or dancer, let me tell you, you are in no small danger: you must
learn to roar like an old frog, till you are hoarse, and take care that you
lead up the chorus3 for when every body else is silent, to throw in a studied
eulogium, will fhew your sstill in adulation: and. yet to be crowned and
anointed, and at the same time have neither viciuals nor drink, is truly ri-
diculous. You are like the monument of a person lately dead, which the
relaticns dress up, and pour ointments upon, whilst they eat the meat, and
drink the wine themselves. Add to all this, that if your patron be jealous‚
his wife young, or his children handsome, if Venus and the Graces have
not utterly renounced you, there may be no small danger. The great have
always a number of ears and eyes about them 3 eyes that sometimes see, not
only what is really done, but what they would have it thought you do;
when you fit at table, therefore, you must look down, as the Perfians do,

was myself‚ not long fince, at a great man’s table, and in company with an unhappy female
dependant on the family, one Mrs. Gibbons‚ (for that name will serve the readeras well as her
real one) who not having been taken notice of in the hob and nob round, took the liberty to
fignify her inclinations, just by saying in a low voice to the servant as he paffed by her, 1 wilh
I had a glass of wine, john : to which John very coolly replied (but without helping her to

one), lwifh you had, Mrs. Gibbons.
