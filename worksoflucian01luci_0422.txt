Ι mentioned3 and to which, their novelty served as a crown, or ornament,
to set off and recommend thern, so that there might be some parts deserving
of serious applause. This reflection soothed my pride, and made me almost
believe them, when they told me, I was the only good Grecian writer„a=
misaele of parts, and so forth3 and yet, perhaps, they would have given
this kind of praise to a mountebank.

I will tell you a story of Zeuxis. That famous painter seldom chose to
handle trite and common subjects, such as heroes, gods, and battles, but
always endeavoured to strike out something new, and exerted all his art and
skill upon it : amongst other things, he painted a female centaur, with two
young ones: there is an exa& copy of it now at Athens-‚3 the original was
said to have been sent into Italy by Sylla the Roman general, and lost at sea
with the whole cargO, somewhere, l believe, near Malta. The copy, how·
ever, I have seen, and will describe to you3 not that I pretend to be ajudge
of pietures, but because, when I saw it in a painter’s collec'tion, there, it
made a strong impreffion on me, and I perfeffitly recolleet every part of it.

ὕ The Centaur is lying down on a smooth turf; that part which represents—
a mare, is stretched on the ground, with the hind feet extended backwards31
the forefeet not reaching out as if she laid on her fide, but one of them as
kneeling, with the hoof bent under, the other raised up, and trampling on-
the grass, like a horse prepared to leap :⁴ she holds one of the young ones in·
her arms, and suckles it. like a child at her woman's breast3 and the other at1
ther dugs like a colt. In the farther part of the pisture, is seen a male cen·
taur, as watching from a place of observation, supposed to be the father3 he‘
is behind, and discovers only the horse part of the figure, and appears smil-
ing, shewing a lyon’s cub, which he lifts up, as if to frighten the young ones-
in sport.

With regard to correetness in drawing, the colouring, † light and shade,¹
symmetry, proportion‚ and other beauties of this picture3 as l am not a suf-
ficient judge of the art, Ι leave it to painters, whose bufiness it is to explain
and illustrate them: whatl principally admire in Zeuxis is, his ssiewing so

ἅ <The Centaur] The picsture of Zeuxis is very exaffly and accurately described by Lucian, and

according to his account, had no small degree of merit in it. Zeuxis, ifwe may credit our au-
thor, must have been the S‘russns of antiquity.

ἦ Light ana'stmdc] Gr. Σκιασαι ες &om—Umbrarum rationem ; what can this mean, but the

knowlege of light and {hade ? This, however, according to the judgment ofsome modern critics‚
,was unknown to the ancients.
