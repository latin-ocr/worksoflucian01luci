break and disappear, others last longer, and meeting with more ‘m their
passage, grow to a larger fize3 but these als0‚ in a little time, burst, and are
diffolved into nothing3 nor can it be otherwise: such are the lives of rnen;

And yet, such as they are, how do men employ them, how eagerly do
they contend for honours, wealth, and empire3 all which they must leave
behind them, and come down to us at last with a fingle farthing! As we
are seated on an eminence, suppose Ishould call out to them as loud as 1
can, and exhort them to leave off their idle pursuits, and, in the midst of
life, ever to have death before their eyes : “ Fools, as ye are, would Ι say to
them, why do you seek after these things with so much anxiety? Cease from
your labours, for you cannot live for ever: none of those things, which
now appear so defirable to you, are eternal; nor, when you die, can you
carry them along with you : naked you must all depart hence 3 your houses,
fields‚ and riches must go to others, and soon change theIr master.'' By
talking thus to them, could I make them hear, might not, think you, hu-

Now green in youth, now withering on the ground;
Another race the following spring supplies,
They fall successive, and succeffive rise3
So generations in their course decay,

There is the same thought in the book of Ecclefiasticus‚ ‘⁴ As of the green leaves of a thick

and another is born.”
