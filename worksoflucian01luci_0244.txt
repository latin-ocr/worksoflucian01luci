swords for your army, or do you think iron ones would not be more ne·

ceffary?
C R OE S U S.

Iron, no doubt.
S O L O N.

Yes, or your gold would be carried captive into Perfia.

C R OE S U S.
Good words, 1 beseech you, man.

S 0 L O N. „
Heaven forbid it should be so: you see, however, that iron is confeffedly A*

better than gold.
C R OE S U S.

And would you have me present iron ingots to the deity, and call my

gold back again ?
S O L 0 N.

He stands no more in need of one than the other: but whether you give
him gold or brass, or any thing else, it will only fall to the stiare of the
Phocians, the Boeotiam, the Delphians themselves, or, perhaps, to some
royal plunderer: for the god himself cares very little for your gold-makers·

C R OE S U S.
You are always railing at, and envying my riches.

You see, Charon, the Lydian cannot bear truth and freedom ε it appears
strange to him that a poor man should talk so openly to him without fear
or trembling ε but the time will soon come when he 111311 remember Solon,
when 116 111311 be taken prisoner by Cyrus, and ascend the funeral pile ε for, but
the other day, Ι heard Clotho reading over the destinies of men, where it was
written that Croesus should be led captive by Cyrus, and Cyrus himself ssain
by the Maffagete ε seest thou that Scythiam woman, on the white horse ?

CHARON.

Ido. .
MERCURY.

That is Tomyris, who 111311 kill Cyrus with her own hand, ancl throw
his head into a vessel of blood. But do you see yonder, that youth? it is

his son Cambyses z he 111311 succeed his father in the empire, and after many
mlsfortunes in Lydia and AEthiopia, kill Apis, and die raving mad.
