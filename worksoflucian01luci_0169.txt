DIALOGUE IV.

ZENOPHANTES Am) CALLIDEMIDES.

CALLIDEMIDES.
AH! Zenophantes‚ how came you here? Ι, you know, was suffocated

by eating too much at Dineas’s feast3 you were there, 1 think, yourself,

whenIdied.
ZENOPHANTES.

1 was s0, Callidemides: but my accident was a very extraordinary one:
you know old Ptaodotus.

CALLIDEMIDES.
The rich old cuff, without children, whom you used to attend so con·

stantly. ZENOPHANTES.

The same: I paid my court to him a long time, hoping he would soon
tip off, and leave me all his money : but the affair being tedioussy protracted,
and the old fellow threatening to live to the age of* Tithonus, I found out
ashorter way to his estate, bought some poison, and prevailed on his cup-
bearer, whenever he should call for drink, for he topes freely, to put some
into his cup, and be ready to give it him: which, if he performed cleverly,
1 bound myself by oath to give him his liberty.

CALLIDEMIDES.
Well, and what happened ? this is an extraordinary affair, indeed.

ZENOPHANTES.

Why, when we came into the room after bathing, and the young fellow
had got the cups ready, one for Ptaodotus with the poison, and the other
for me, how it happenedI know not, but by some mii’take, he gave me the
poisoned cup, and him the other; he drank up his, and 1 in a moment fell

down dead before him: thus Zenophantes died instead of Ptaodorus. You
smne, Callidemides: you should not laugh at a friend's misf01·tune.

ἕ· Tithonus] Son of Laomedon, and brother to Priam, being a beautiful youth, Aurora,
fell in love with, and carried him 0ff3 at her request, Jupiter made him immortal; but his
mistress having forgot to ask for perpetual youth, as well as immortaliry‚ as he advanced in
years he felt all the infirmities of old age, and was, consequently, miserable. Jupiter, at
length, says the fable, took pity on, and turned him into a grasshopper. On the sufferinge of
Tithonus, who was only more wretched by being immortal, was probably founded Swit't's idea

of the Strulbrugs, in his Gulliver.
