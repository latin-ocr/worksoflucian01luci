WRITINGS oF LUCIAN. xv

LORD LYTTELTON.
Your life, if I have been rightly informed, wasa pretty
long one: but, pray, what, after all, put an end to it?

for of thiS‚ as of many other things concerning you, we
have had various accounts,

LUCIAN.

worried me to death: another has charitably configned
me to hell flameS, which, notwithstanding, I have hither-
t0, as you see, had the good fortune to escape, and all
this, Ibelieve, on account of a little tra& called † Philo-
patriS, which, between friendS‚ I had no hand in; but
the real cause of my death was, by HerculeS‚ that rascally
disorder, which had killed so many honest fellows before*
me, even that opprobrium medicorum the ssGout, whose
attacks I severely felt for many yearS, who at last snatched.
me away in the prime of my life, and transported me, in
the ninetieth year. of my age, from a wicked world to
these happy mansionS‚ where I have now the pleasure off
converfing with your Lordship.

pieces by dogs as he returned from a feast.

† Philopatri5·] See the Transsation, vol. ii. p. 544. This tra&, together with that
on the Death of Peregrinus, were both proscribed in the Romish Index Expurgatorius,

during the Pontificate of Alexander Vll. as not fit to be read by Christians.
