Aristarchus, the grammarian& 1 then afked him how he carne to begin
his lli-ad man the wrath of Achilles; he said, it was all by chance. I de.
sired lil-:ewise to know whether, as it was generally reported, he wrote the
Odyliey before the lli-ad? He said no. It is commonly said he was blind,
butil {osin found he was not so: for he made use of his eyes, and looked
nt me, 11111111 Ι had no reason to ask hirn that question ε whenever I found
him dil‘engaged, I took the opportunity of converfing with him, and he
very readily entered into discourse with me, especially after the vidtory-
which he obtained over Therfites, who had accused him of turning him into
ridicule in some of his verses3 the cause was heard before RhadamanthuS,
and Homer came off vifmrious. Ulyfl'es pleaded for him.

I met also Pythagoras the Samiam, who arrived in these regions after his
soul had gone a long round in the bodies of several animals; having been
changed seren times, All his right fide was of gold, and there was some
dispute whether he should be called Pythagoras or EuphorbuS. Empe·
docles came likewise, who looked sodden and> roasted all over: he defired
admittance3 but though he begged hard for it, was rejected.

A little tirne after, the garnes came 011, which they call here ⁹3- Thanatufia,
Achilles prefided for the fifth time, and Theseus for the seventh. A narra·
rive of the whole would be tedious, I ssiall only, therefore, recount a few
of the principal circumstances in the wrestling match; Carus, a descendant
of Hercules, conquered Ulyss'es at the boxing match. Areus the AEgyptian,
who was buried at Corinth, and Epeus contended‚ but neither got the vic-
tory. The Pancratia was not proposed amongst them. In the racel do
not remember who had the superiority. ln poetry Homer was far beyond
them all; Hefiod, however, got a prize. The reward to all was a garland
of peacock's feathers.

XVhen the games were over, word was brought that the prisoners in Tar-
tarus had broke loose, overcome the guard, and were proceeding to take
possession of the issand under the command of ss Phalaris the Agrigentine,

-i- Thaumasia] Death-games‚ or, games after death, in imitation of wedding-games,
funeral-games, διε.

1 Phalaris.] The famous tyrant of Agrigentum, renowned for his ingenious contrivance of
roasting his enemies in a brazen bull, and not less memorable for some excellent Epiffles, which

set a wit and scholar together by the ears concerning the genuineness of thern. See the famous
contest between Bentley and Boyle.
