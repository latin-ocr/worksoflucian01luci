PHILOSOPHERS.

Νιοιιηῐσε, α Roman, or Greek philost>pher (for the commentators are divided about
that matter), had nufi probably given fhme leHures, which LUCIAN, in the course of
l:1‘s travels, amended, and, in gratitude fhr the instrucrions received from him, wrote
this dialogice, which he ſsent, as we may suppofi’‚ before publication, with the
short epistle prefixed, to Nummus himself. T he 'philosopher is here described as a
perfec'l mester of the science which he profeffed‚ iissrurfling his scholars in every
thing that was good and great, living up to his doc‘lrine, and reproving thefashion-
able follies of his time, with a spirit and freedom becoming the advocate ofvtruth
and virtue. In his ridicule of the reigning vices of his age, Lucum has put into
the mouth of NicRINus no inconfiderable share of his own wit and humour.
This dialogue is admirably written, in a fine flowing agreeable style, and, per-
haps, one of his best serious pieces. ⁴

EPISTLE to NIGRINUS.

UCIAN to NigrinuS, sendeth greeting. Who sends † owls to Athens?
says the proverb3 as if it were ridiculous to carry them there, where
there are already so many ε as absurd would it be in me to write a book,
to shew my oratory, and send it to Nigrinus. But as I only mean to de-
clare my present sentiments, and to shew my high opinion of your elo-
quence, I flatter myselfI shall not incur the censure of Thucydides, who

tells us, that ignorance makes men bold, but knowlege keeps them humble3

'³⁴ The commentators have given us another title to this picce, and call it, “ concern-
ing the Manners of Philosophers ;’' but as no philosopher is mentioned except Ni-
grinus himself, who differed greatly from the generality of them, the title is both absurd and
unneceffiiry.

† Owls to Athene] The owl, though degraded by modern times into an emblem of folly,
was considered by the ancients as a type of wisdom, and the favourite bird of Minerva, the pa-
troness of Αῐῖιετηε, where, no doubt, she formerly was treated with great respect. Owls were
consequently very numerous t hence arose the proverb which is quoted by Erasmus and other
writers. ‘1 hc saying is analogous to our own, of ‘⁴ carrying coals to Newcastle.''
