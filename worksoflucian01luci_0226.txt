‚90 MENIPPUS;on,·1-ns

myselfwith the refleifion, that though I ‘remained still ignorant, and wan-
dering about in the search of truth, I was a fool, however, in good com-
pany, and had many of those, who were most celebrated for their wit and
wisdom, to keep me in countenance. One night, at length, as 1 laid sseep-
less, and thinking on this matter, it came into my head that I would go to
Babylon, and ask the assistance of some magi, the disciples aud succeffors of
Zoroaster ε these, I had heard, could, by certain ceremonies and incantations,
open the doors of hell, set a man down there, and bring him safe back
again, whenever they pleased: the best way, therefore, I thought, was,
leave being first obtained from some of them, to go immediately to old Ti-
refias, the Boeotiam, and learn os that wise prophet, what was really the best
rule of life, which a prudent man should go by; and, accordingly, leaping
up as fast as l could, Ι made the best of my way to Babylon, where 1 met
witha certain Chaldaean‚ a wise man, a diviner by profeffion, with white
hair, and a most venerable beard, whose name was Mithrobarzanes: whom,
after much supplication and intreaty, I at last prevailed on to conducit me,
on his own terms, to the infernal regions: he then took me, at the time of
the new moon, ‘and washed me nine and twenty days in the Euphrates, with

⁷ my face towards the rising sun, repeating at the same time a long speech,
which l could not well hear, as he spoke it like one of our public criers,
who give you something rapid and imminet, which you can never under-
stand ε he seemed, however, to invoke some daemons; and, after the incan-
tation, spitting three times in my face, returned3 taking no notice of, nor
even seeing those that met us. Our food was acornS, our drink milk
and homey, or the water of Choaspes: we ssept upon the grass, in the
open air: after being thus dieted, Ι was led, in the middle of the night, to
the Tigris, where he wassoed, and then purified me with torches and sea-
leeks, and so forth, not forgetting to mumble over his incantation : then, to
complete the charm, and save me harmless from the spectres, he walked -
round me, and thus prepared, making me wall< backwards all the way, led
me home ε the rest of the night was spent in preparing for our voyage: he
was cloathed himself inla kind of magic garment, much resembling the
Median dress, and equipped me, as you see, with this cap, a lion's skin, and
a lyre; telling me, if any body asszed my name, lshould not say it was Me-

nippus, but “ Hercules, Orpheus, or Ulyffes.

Ἃ· Hercules, fija] Because these three heroes had all been indulged with the privilege of vifit.
ing the infernal regions 3 Menippus, consequently, might pass and repass there unmolested.
