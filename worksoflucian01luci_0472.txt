436 THETRUEHISTORY.

Of a swans, swallows, and nightingales; and to these succeeds the sweet
rustling of the Zephyrs, that whistle through the woods, and close the con-
cert. When most contributes to their happiness is, that near the symposium
arc two fountains, the one of milk, the other of pleasure 3 from the first they
drink at the beginning of the feast, there is nothing afterwards but joy and
festivity.

I will now tell you what rnen of renown Ι met with there; and first, there
were all the demi-gods, and all the heroes that fought at Troy, except
ψ Ajax the Locrian, who alone it seems was condemned to suffer for his
crimes in the habitations of the wicked3 then there were of the Barbarians,
both the Cyrus's, Anacharsis the Scythiam, ssZamolxis of Thrace, and
4. Numa the Italian3 besides these Ι met with Lycurgus the Spartan, Pho-
cion and Tellus of Athens, and all the wise men, except § Periander. I
saw also Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus, prating with Nestor and Pala-
medes3 near him were Hyacinthus of Sparta, Narciffus the Thespian, Hy-
las, and several other Η beauties; he seemed very fond of Hyacinthus;
some things were laid to his charge 3 it was even reported that Rhadaman-
thus was very angry with him, and threatened to turn him out of the issand,
if he continued to play the fool, and would not leave off his irony and sar-

antiquity. A proper account and explanation of this is, 1 think, amongst the desiderata of li-
terature. There is an entertaining tra& on this subje& in the Hist. de l’Acad. tom. ν. by M. Morin.

† Ajax the Locrian] Who ravished Cassandra, the daughter of Priam, and priestess of Mi-

nerva, who sent a teinpest, dispersed the Grecian navy in their return home, and sunk Ajax
with a thunder-bolt.

ζ lamala-in] A scholar of Pythagoras.

-l- Numa] The second king of Rome.

ξ Per.·'ander.] One of the seven fages, but excepted against by Lucian, because he was
king of Corinth, and a tyrant.

Η Remmiam] A malevolent sneer at Socrates, who, if we credit our severe satirist‚ had other
pleasures in the company ofbeautiful young rnen, befides that ofinstruffing them: though this

iss, mdost probably, an asperfion on the character of that noble philosopher, which he never de·

q Plato.] See his Treatise de Republica His quitting Elysium, to live in his oven re-
public, is a stroke oftrue humour.
