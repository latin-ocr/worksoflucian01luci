DIALOGUE XXVIII.

MENIPPUS ΛΝΒ CHIRON.

MENIPPUS.

Ι HAVE heard, Chiron, that though you might have been a god, you

rather chose to die.
C H 1 R O N.

What you heard was very true3 and, as you see, Ι am '³²⁴ dead, though Ι
might have been immortal-

E N I P P U S.
What could make youhsi) fond of death, a thing in the eyes of most men

so unlovely?
C H I R O N.

As you are no fool, 1 will tell you; 1 found no pleasure in immortality.

M E N I P P U S.

C H 1 R Ο N.
It was: pleasure in my opinion confists not in sameness, but variety3 to

live for ever, to enjoy the same things, see the same sun, and eat the same
food, to count the same hours, and see every thing in life recurring in con·
tinual succeflion, brought on satiety: there is no happiness but in change.

M E N 1 P P U S.
True, Chiron3 but how like you these infernal regions, which you were

so defirous of a vifit to?
C H 1 R O N.

O, paffing well, Menippus: equality is agreeable to all, and whether
what we do ‘is done in light or darkness it matters not; befides, that here we

neither hunger nor thirst, as in the other world, but are free from every

want.
MENIPPUS.

Take heed, Chiron, that you do not contradict yourself, and fall into the
'very error you declaim against.

* Dead.] Chiron, however, was, according to all accounts, a gainer by the bargain, being

afterwards promoted by Jupiter to a star-strip in heaven, which he stin enjoys in the zodiac,
under the name of Sagittarius⁸
