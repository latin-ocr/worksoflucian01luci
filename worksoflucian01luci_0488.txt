452 THETY'RANT-KILLER.

who now commands? what master now threatens us ? hath any of the wicked
doers escaped me? none, you must say, none. Every thing is in peace,
and the laws prevail. Freedom is uninterrupted, the deniocracy is establish-.
ed, marriage is unreproached, our children are fearless, our virgins are se-
cure, and the whole city hath instituted public festivals to celebrate its corn-
mon happiness. NVho is the author of all this ? who put an end to our ca·-
lamities, and produced this happiness? if there be any more worthy of this
honour than myself‚ to himlyield the reward: but I alone have done
all this, Iwent through the danger3 1 went up, Issew, Ipunished‚ Ire-
venged myself on one, by the affistance of another. Wherefore dost thou
thus abuse my noble cleeds? wherefore wouldest thou persuade the people to
'be ungrateful fo me?

But you did not (says one,) ssay the tyrant himself, and the law decrees the
reward to the tyrant-killer. And where, tell me, is the difference between
killing him one's sels, or being the cause of his death? surely none. All
that the legissator looked to, was the liberty and power of the people, and to
free them from every injury3 this claimed the honour, and this merited the
reward: this which you cannot deny but I performed: for ifI destroyed
him, after whose death the other could not survive, I was doubtless the de·
stroyer os the other als03 the ssaughter was mine, though by his own hand.
Dispute no longer, therefore, on the manner of his death, nor how he fell ;.
hut ask whether he yet lives, or is no more? whether Ι gave him that which
caused him to be no more ? otherwise, you might as well dispute his title to
the reward, who should kill the tyrant not with a sword, but with a stone, a
club, or any thing else. What if Ι had starved him to death, would you
then have objedted that Idid not kill him with my >own hand; or say, that
something still was wanting according to the law, though the criminal would
then have died a more cruel death. Adhere, therefore, to this only, ask
this question alone, be inquifitive about nothing but this, Which of the evil
doers is still alive? what are we now afraid of? where is even the remem-
brance of our woes ? if every thing is now pure, if every thing is peaceable ς.
itis only the part of a calumniator, to make use of the mere manner of the
action, only to prevent its deserved reward.

If, from the length of a continued ssavery, Ι have not forgot the laws, it is
there said, I think, that there are two causes of death ε ifa man kills a per·
son with his own hand, or if he forces another to do it, and is the cause of'

his.
