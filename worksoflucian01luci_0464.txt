these, however, on condition of paying an annual tribute to the Pfittipodes
of five hundred oysters. Such is the fituation of this country·, our difficult)⁷
is how to oppose so many people, and find sustenance for ourselves.?’ “ How
many may there be, said I ?'' “ More than a thousand, said he.'' “ And what are
their arms ?'' “ Nothing, replied he, but {issi-bones? “ Then, said I, we had best
go to war with them, for we have arms and they none3 if we conquer them
we shall live without fear for the future.” This was immediately agreed upon,
and, as soon as we returned to our stup, we began to prepare. The cause
of the war was to be the non-payment of the tribute, which was just now be-
coming due: they sent to demand it3 he returned a contemptuous answer
to the meffengers : the Pfittopodes and Paguradae were both highly enraged,
and immediately fell upon Scintharus (for that was the old man’s name), in
a most violent manner. Ι
We, expecting to be attacked, sentout a detachment of five and twenty
men, with orders to lie concealed till the enemy was past, and then to rise
upon them, which they did, and cut off their rear: we, in the mean time,
being likewise five and twenty in number, with the old 'man and his son,
waited their coming up, met, and engaged them with no little danger, till
at length they fied, and we pursued them even into their trenches: of the
enemy there fell an hundred and twenty; we lost only one, our pilot, who
was run through by the rib of a mullet. That day, and the night after ir,
we remained on the field of battle, and erected the dried back-bone ofa dol-
phin as a trophy. Next day some other forces, who had heard of the en-
gagement, arrived, and made head against us3 the Tarichanes, under the

command of Pelamus‚ in the right wing, the Thynnoccphali on the left, and
the Carcinochires in the middle3 the 'l'ritonomendetes remained neuter, not
chufing to affist either party ε we came round upon all the rest, by the¹
temple of Neptune, and with a hideous cry rulhed upon them 3 as they were-
unarmed, we soon put them to ssight, pursued them into the wood‚ and
took poffesfion of their territory. They sent ambaffadors a little while after,
to take away their dead, and propose terms of peace; but we would hear
of no treaty, and attacking them the next day, obtained a complete victory,
and cut them all off, except the Tritonomendetes, who, informed of what had
paffed, ran away up to the whale’s gills, and from thence threw themselves
into the sea. The country being now cleared of all enemies, we ratnbled
through it, and from that time remained without fear, used what exercise
