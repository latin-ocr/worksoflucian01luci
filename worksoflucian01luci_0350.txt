upon, that he may pick up another who is better able to serve him. He
accuses you then of debauching his wife's maid, or some such thing, and
you are turned out headlong at midnight; old as you are, poor, friendlesS‚
and, perhaps, with a swinging gout upon you. After such a length of time,
you have forgot every thing which you knew, and have nothing left but a
belly as big as a hogssiead, which you can neither fill nor get rid of ς for your
throat, from habit, is perpetually soliciting you, and cannot without-mur-
mur and repining unlearn what it has been so long accustomed to. Thus
worn out as you are, nobody else will take you in, for you are now like au
old horse, whose very skin is good for nothing. Add to this, that the scan-
dal of being turned off will make people suspe& you as an adulterer, a sor-
cerer, or something worse3 your accuser will be believed, as a man of cre-
dit3 but you are a Greek, of a light character, and fit for every thing that is
bad3 for such they suppose us all to be, and, perhaps, with some justice.
The cause of this opinion, I believe, may be eafily gueffed at3 many of us,
who know nothing good or useful, get into houseS, where they prac‘tise ma-

can turn afide misfortunes on the heads of their enemies3 and this they do
by boasting their learning, putting on long cloaks, and wearing such beards
as are not to be despised. It is no wonder, therefore, they should suspect

us all, when those whom they had so high an opinion of, are guilty of such
things, and submit to the meanest flattery for the sake of gain.

Those whom they dismiss from their service, moreover, they generally
bear the most inveterate hatred against, and endeavour as much as they can
utterly to ruin and destroy 3 naturally suppofing that such men will lay open .‚
their whole lives and manners, which they are intimately acquainted with,
and this it is which hurts them ; for they exaitly resemble those books whose
outfide is purple and gold, and within you find nothing but Thyestes seed-
ing on his own children, Oedipus committing incest with his mother, or
Tereus pursuing the two fisters : such are these men als0, very fine and splen-
did, with a great deal of tragedy under their purple3 is you open one of
them you will find a fit subject for Sophocles or EuripideS, though they are
all gold and finery without: conscious of this, they always hate, and plan
the destruetion of those whom they have turned away, and who know them

well, lest they ssiould bring them on the public stage„
