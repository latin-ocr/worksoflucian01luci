quite ripe. We were greatly astonished, as you may suppose, and prayed
most devoutly to the gods, to avert the evil which was portended.

We had not gone above five hundred stadia farther, before we saw an im-
mensely large and thick wood of pines and cypruses; we took it for a trac't of
land, but it was all a deep sea, planted with trees that had no root, which
stood, however, unmoved, upright, and, as it were, swirnming in it: ap-
proaching near to it, we began to consider what we could do best3 there was
no sailing between the trees, which were close together, nor did we know
how to get back. Ι got upon one of the highest of them, to see how far
they reached, and perceived that they continued for about fifty stadia or more,
and beyond that it was all sea again: we resolved, therefore, to drag the ship
up to the top-boughs, which were very thick, and so convey it along, which,
by fixing a great rope to ir, with no little toil and difficulty, we performed3
got it up, spread our sails, and were driven on by the wind. It put me in
mind of that verse of Antimachus the poet, where he says,

The ssiip sail'd smoothly through the sylvan sea.

We at length got over the wood, and, letting our ship down in the same
manner, fell into smooth clear water, till we carne to a horrid precipice hol-
low and deep, resembling the cavity rnade by an earthquake, we furled our
faiis, or should soon have been swallowed up in it. Stooping forward, and
looking down, we beheld a gniph of at least a thousand stadia deep, a most
dreadful and amazing sight, sor the sea as it were was split in two. Looking
towards our right hand, however, we saw a small bridge of water thatjoined
the two scas, and flowed from one into the other; we got the ship in here,
and with great labour rowed her over, which we never expected.

From thence we paffed into a smooth and calm sea, wherein was a small
issand with a good landing-place‚ and which was inhabited by the Bucephali;
a savage race of men, with bul'ls heads and horus, as they paint the mino-
taur. As soon as we got on shore we went in search of water and provifion,
for we had none left, water we found soon, but nothing else: we heard, in-
deed, a kind of lowing at a distance, and expected to find a herd of oxen,
but, advancing a little farther, perceived that it came from the men. As
soon as they saw us, they ran after and took two of our companions, the
rest of us got back to the ship as fast aa we could. We then got our arms,
and, determined to revenge our friends, attacked thern as they were divid-

ing the flesh of our poor companions : they were soon thrown into confusion
