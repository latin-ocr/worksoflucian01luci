Tne TYRANT-KILLER. 453

his death, he is equally to be punished : and surely with the greatest justice,
for the law considered the power given, equal to the fact itself. It is unne-
ceffary, therefore, to enquire into the mode of doing it: The man who
thus kills another, you acknowlege, should be punished, and would, by ¹no

means have him excused sor it. Why, therefore, should not he for the
same reason be rewarded, who has done, be the manner what it would, a pub-

lic service? neither can you say that I did it by chance, and that this event
happened beyond my expectation. What had Ι to sear, when the strongcr
of the two, and he who alone could refist me, was already ssain ? why did I
⁹ leave the sword in his throat, if I had not foreseen what would happen? un·-

less you will say, perhapS, that he who thus perissied was not really the ty-
rant, nor was so called, neither if he died, would you have given any more
rewards. Would you therefore, when the tyrant is ssain, with-hold the re·
ward from him who ssew him ? what a ridiculous solicitude about nothing!
why need you care how he died, if you enjoy your liberty? or, would you<

law, as you acknowlege yourself, takes notice of the principa] circumstance,
and enquires concerning nothing else: why then should not he who has ex·
pelled the tyrant, receive the reward of a tyrant-killer ? certainly he ought·
in justice to have it, for he substituted freedom in the room-of ssavery. There
is no baniihment here, no fear of future invasion. This aetion of mine has
made a final destruction, cut off at once the whole race, and totally extirpat-

ed the evil.
And now enquire, 1 beseech you, whether I have omitted any one thing

which the law prescribes, or if any thing be still wanting to fulfil it. First,
and above all, it is neceffary to have a brave and a d'aring foul, ready to go
through every danger for the public good, and sacrifice its own sasety to the

honour of the state; have Iin this been wanting, haveI ever been sofrened “

or effeminate, did l lay afide the enterprize at the thoughts of difficulty or
danger? Ye cannot say it3 confider me, therefore, as only making the re-
solution, even if my attempt had not succeeded, and say whether 1 ought
not to demand the reward ε would it have been unreasonable even if I could
not have done it, and another had ssain him afterwards; if Ihad said, I,
Ofellow citizens, planned this enterprize, l pursued‚ and 1 attempted, Ι
therefore merit the reward3 what answer would you make me? But this I do

not say3 1 say that I ascended into the fort, that I incurred many dangers,
