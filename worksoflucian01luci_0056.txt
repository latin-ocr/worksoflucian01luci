thers, legacy-hunting, and pretended friendffiips ? What can you do when
you can no longer have it in your power to leave it, nor at the same time
can ever bring yourself to comply with the modes and customs of it ? &Vhen
I had thus consulted my own beart, and withdrawn myself, as Jupiter, they
tell us, withdrew ³* 1-1εᾶοτ from the battle,

Safe from the darts, the care of heav’n he stood,
Amidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.

Like him, Idetermined to remain at horne, and chose this inaEtive, and
what some would call effeminate way of life, that 1 may converse with

Plato, philosophy, and truth. Here, placing myself, as it were on a high
seat in a crouded theatre, Ilook down on what is paffing below, a scene

sometimes of mirth and entertainment, and sometimes of such hazard and
danger, as puts virtue to the proof. If even the worst of things, as it may
sometimes happen, deserve praise for the good they may produce, Ι know no
better school of virtue, no better place of trial for the mind of man,
than this very city, and the modes and habits of it. It is not an
easy talk to refist the attacks of so many diverfions, pleasures, and amuse-
ments, the variety of temptationS, which on every fide, and from every
sense attrae‘t and betray us. But we should follow the example of Ulyffes,

and sail by thern, not like his followerS, bound hand and foot, that, indeed,
would be frightfu13 nor waxing up our ears, but free, open, and determined,
with a mind rifing superior to them ε how low does such folly fink, when
put in competition with that philosophy which contemns the gifts of for-
tune, which beholds, as on a stage, a multiplicity of characters in perpetual
change; sees the servant made a lord, the poor turned to rich, and the rich
to poor, friends one moment, and enemies the next; but what we should
most larnent is, that though fortune is for ever sporting with human affairs,
and convincing us that there is nothing stable, nothing to be depended on,
those, notwithstanding, who are every day speetators of them, still fall in
love with siches and power, still intoxicate themselves with vain and idle
hopes of what can never be poffeffed.

But Ι will now proceed to what, as I observed to you, will delight and
entertain us, the objeets of mirth and ridicule. What can be more contempt-
iblethan those rich fools, who are always ssiewing their purple garments,
