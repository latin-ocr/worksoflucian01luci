DIALOGUE XXI.

DORIS AND THETIS.

D O R Ι S.
Thetis, what makes you weep thus?

T H E T I S.
Doris, I havejust now seen a most beautiful ἥ young creature, shut up in
a chefe, with her new-born infant, by her cruel father, who ordered the
sailors, when they had got a good way out from land, to throw the chest
into the sea, that they might both periss1. ,

Ι) O R I S.
Pray, fister, for what reason? for I suppose you know the whole affair.

T H E T 1 S.

Her father, Acrifiu5‚ as she was exceffively handsome, had locked her up
in a brazen tower, to preserve her virginity‚· and, they say, whether true
or false I know not, that Jupiter rushed in upon her, through the tiles, in a
golden shower3 that ihe received the flowing god into her bosom, and be-
came pregnant. As soon as her father, a morose and spiteful fellow, per.
ceived it, he was violently enraged at her, imagining she must have been

debauched by somebody3 and, as soon as she was brought to bed, threw
her, child and all, into this chest.

D Ο R I S.
And how did she behave upon it?

“ Young creature‚] Danae, daughter of Acrifius, king of Argos. The story is too well
known to stand in need of any elucidation.
