B 1 D D E R.
How will you do that ?

But suppose it is purified already, how are yon to recall the memory ?

ἱ· Forfive whole years] The injunction of five years filence, said to be laid by Pythagoras on
all his disciples, probably meant no more, than a prohibition from attempting to teach or in-
stru& others, till they had spent that portion of time in fully acquainting themselves with every
part of his doetrine: an injunffion very proper in every age, and which would not be unservice-
able in our own, by preventing many of our raw young divines from expofing themlelves in the
pulpit‚ before they have read their Greek Testament. -

† Son quroesics.] This alludes to the following story. The son of Croesus, king of Lydia,
who was born dumb, and had continued so to the age of maturity‚ attending his father to battle,
saw a soldier, in the heat of the engagement, lifting up his sword over the head of Croesus3 the
apprehenfion ot‘ a father's imminent danger worked so power-fully on the mind of an affectionate
child as ona sudden to loosen his tongue‚ which had been tied up for so many years, and hc
cried out immediately, “ Soldier, do not kin Croesus.”
