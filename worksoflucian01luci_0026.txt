S a Complete Transsation of Lucian was promised in the Proposals, some
Apology may be thought necessary for the omisfion of the few fol·

lowing tracis 2 viz.

The >›.÷ Am„ φωνηεντωνς or, Judgment of the Vowels.

ln this little piece Sigma, or the letter S, complains of the injury done
him by Tan, or T's, intruding himself into several words where he had no

right to appear3 that Thalatta, for instance, is used instead of Thalassa,
and so forth. The subjec't is treated with great humour, in the manner of
a judicial process, and in some measure resembles Addison’s petition of Who
and thih in the speetator. But as the examples adduced are confined en-
tirely to the Greek language, it was impoffible to represent a proper idea
of it in a transsation.

† negt τε εν τη προσαγορευσει πταισμοιτος; or, aMistake in Saluting a Friend.

Lucian had met one morning an old acquaintance, and instead of saying
Χαιρε, or, Good morrow, had made use of the word Syaoesvs, or Farewel!
This had probably brought on him the censure of some severe critics for
want of accuracy and precifion, which he endeavours in this piece to ex-
cuse, by observing that the word Χαιξε was not only used by many authors
at meeling but at parting als0, and the word ‘Tyaoeave indifferently on both oc-
cafions. He quotes at the same time several passages from poets and his-
torians in his defence3 but as the fa& itself is, at this distant period of
time, very uninteresting‚ and the whole of the tra& turns upon two words
in the Greek language, the precise signification of which cannot be well
ascertained in our own, Ι have entirely omitted it.
