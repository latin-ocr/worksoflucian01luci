PANOPE ΑΝ» GALENE.

P A N O P E.
DlD you observe, Galene, what Eris did at the banquet in Theffaly,
because she was not invited to it herself?

G A L E N E.
1 was not there, Panope, having been commanded by Neptune to keep
the sea smooth, during the entertainment : but what was it?

P A N O P E.
Peleus and Thetis, condu&ed by Neptune and Amphitrite, had retired

to their chamber: Eris, in the mean time, unknown to any body, (for she
could not well be discovered, whilst some were drinking, others applaud-
ing Phoebus playing on the harp, or listening to the songs of the Muses)
threw into the room a most beautiful apple, all over gold, with this in-
scription on it, fbr thefczirqst. It rolled about, and stopped, as it were on
purpose, at the place where Juno, Venus, and Minerva were laying down.
lvlercury took it up, and read the inscription. We Nereids said nothing⁷3
what, indeed, could we do when they were present? A contentiori imme-
diately arose between thern, and each claimed it as her own. If Jupiter had
not interfered, they would soon have corne to blows: they would fain have
had him determine it, but he would not. Iwill not be judge, said he, in
this affair: let them go to mount Ida, to Priam' s son, who will distinguish

which is the handsomest3 being an excellentjudge of beauty, and one who

cannot be mistaken.

P A N O P E.
lcan pronounce beforehand, that where Venus contendS, she will have
no superior3 unless thejudge is stark blind.
