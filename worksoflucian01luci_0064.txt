The Timon os Lucum is dcfi’rvedly esteemed one of his best pieces. A fund os

good sense and rfflefiiom enlivened by frequent sullies of wit and humour, runs
through the whole. Our great SHAKSPEARE has filled up Lucmn’s outline,

drawn forth the charaffers into acrion, and fhrmed, from him and P ιιι-[ΛΜΗ

together, no unplecfing drama.

ΤΙΜΟΝ.

Jupiter! the friendly, the hospitable‚ the social, the domestiC‚ the

oath-binder‚ the thunderer, the cloud-compelling, the far-resounding,
or by whatever name thou art called by frantie poets, especially when the
verse halts (for then they have a thousand names to prop the falling metre,
and fill up the hiatus), where is now your crackling lightnIng‚ and your
deep-toned thunder? VVhere are all your white, blazing, and terrific bolts?
All dwindled into nothing3 a mere poetical smoke3 a heap of idle names.
Those unerring, far-shooting dans, so celebrated and beversed, have, Ι
know not how, lost all their fire3 they are grown quite colel, and preserve
not the least spark of wrath for the punishment of the guilty. The
wretch who had forsworn himself, would be rnore afraid of the snuff of a
lamp, than the flame of your all-subduing thunder. The firebrands which
you throw, are quenched in such a manner, that nobody fears being

burned by them ; and all the hurt they can receive from it, is to be co-
vered
