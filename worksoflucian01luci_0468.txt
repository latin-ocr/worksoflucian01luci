¹43² THETRUEHISTORY.

and living upon the fissi which we found in it; but, our provisions failing,
we were obliged to loosen our ship which was stuck fast in, and hoisting a
fail, ssid along through the ice with an easy pleasant motion; on the fifth
day from that time, it grew warm, the ice broke, and it was all water again.

After sailing about three hundred stadia, we fell in upon a little deserted
issand : here we took in water, for ours was almost gone, killed with our ar-
rows two wild oxen, and departed. These oxen had horns not on their heads‚
but, as Momus seemed to wish, under their eyes. A little beyond this, we
got into a sea, not of water, but of milk; and upon it we saw 'an issand full
of vines; this whole issand was one compa& well-made cheese, as we after-
wards experienced by many a good meal, which we made upon it; and is in
length five and twenty stadia. The vines have grapes upon them, which
yieldv not wine, but milk. In the middle of the issand was a temple to the
Nereid t Galataea, as appeared by an inscription on it: as long as we staid there,
the land afforded us victuals to eat, and the vines supplied us with milk to
drink. † Tyro, the daughter of Salmoneus, we were told, was queen of
it, Neptune having, after her death, conferred that dignity upon her.

We stopped five days on this issand, and on the fixth set sail with a small
breeze, which gently agitated the waves, and on the eighth‚ changed our
milky sea for a green and briny one3 where we saw a great number of men
running backwards and forwards, resembling ourselves in every part, except
the feet, which are all of cork, whence, Isuppose, they are called ἶ Phello-
podes. We were surprised to see them not finking, but rifing high above the
anQS, and making their way without the least fear or apprehenfion: they
came up το, and addreffed us in the Greek tongue, telling us they were go-
ing to Phello, their native country3 they accompanied us a good way, and
then taking their leave, wished us a good voyage. A little after we saw se-
veral issands, amongst which, to the left of us stood Phello, to which these
men were going, a city built in the middle of a large round cork3 towards

W Galatica] One of the fifty Nereids, or Sea—Nymphs ; so called, on account of the fairness Ι

of her skin ι from γαλα gala, milk; of the milky issand, therefore, she was naturally the prefid-
ing deity.

† Tyra] Tyro, according to Homer, fell in love with the famous river Enipeus, and was
always wandering on his banks, where Neptune found, covered her with his waves, and throw-
ing her into a deep sseep, supplied the place of Enipeus. Lucian has made her amends, by be-
stowing one of his imaginary kingdoms upon her. His part of the story, however, is fullas pro-
bable as the rest.
