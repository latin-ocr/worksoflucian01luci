MEGAPENTHES·
Only to finifh my house, that is but half-built.

C L 0 T H Ο.
Ridiculous! come along, I tell you.
MEGAPENTHES.
I ask but for a little time, only permit me to stay one day, to give orders
about some money to my wife: Ihave a treasure hid, and would let her

know where it is.
C L Ο T H Ο.

Your fate is determined3 it is impoffible.

MEGAPENTHES.
And must so much gold be lost ?

C L O T H Ο·
It will not be lost, never fear: your relation, MegacleS, will take care

Oflt' *MEGAPENTHES

O dreadful! my worst and most inveterate enemy, whom I was so idle

as notto destroy. C L O T H O

The very man: who will survive you forty years and upwards, poffess
your conwbines, be cloathed in your apparel, and enjoy all your treasures.

MEGAPENTHES.
Itis very unjust‚ thus to bestow all I had on my greatest foes.
C L Ο T H O.
Did not you do the same thing by Cydimachus, when you took all he

had, killed him, and ssew his children before his face, whilst he was breath·

inghislast.
MEGAPENTHES.

They were mine then, however.
C L O T H O.
And now they are your’s no longer.
MEGAPENTHES.

I have something to say to you, Clotho, that no body must hear3 please
to step on one fide. Ifyou will let me go, I will give you a thousand talents
of stamped gold this very day.

C L O T H O.

Still thinking upon gold and talents ? ridiculous !
