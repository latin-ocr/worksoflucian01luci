of his appearance, and decency of his attire; but above all, hythe corn-
posure of his mind, and the sweetness of his manners. He counselled his
followers never to put off, or defer the time of affiting aright, as too many
do, who allot some particular season‚ a public festival perhaps, or solemn
meeting, when they will begin to leave off their vices, and study to be
good. The bent of the soul towards virtue, he thought, was by no means
to be turned afide for a moment3 and blamed those philosophers exceeding-
ly, who harraffed their pupils with perpetual toil ancl labour, compelling
some of them to bind themselves with cords, others to endure ᾗ st1·{pes‚
others, of a more delicate frame, to rase their skin with swords : the firni-

will and testament men; remarking, that the Romans, young or old, speak
truth once in their lives, meaning in their last wills, which they durst not
do before, for sear of bad consequences. 1 could not refrain frorn laughter
when he added on this occasion, that they all would have their follies buried
