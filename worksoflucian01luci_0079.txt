TIMON. 43

T Ι M O N.

Because he was the author of all my past missortunes, gave me up to fiat—
terers, and evil counsellors, corrupted me with perpetual temptations, aud
rendered me the object of hatred and of envy3 but, above all, because he
basely and perfidioussy deserted me. Poverty‚ on the other hand, my best

and truest friend, exercised me with wholesome labours, supplied me with
what was neceffary, and taught me to contemti every thing superfluous, and

to rely upon myself alone3 shewed me what true riches were, those trea-
sures, which neither the fawning sycophant, nor the angry multitude, the
time-serving orator, nor the ensnaring tyrant, can ever wrest from me. Thus

handsomely. I cannot conceive how 1 could ever, though you say it, have

’ done you any injury3 I, who heaped honours, titles, crowriS, every thing

that was good and defirable upon y0u; through me you became conspicuous
and respectable. If you suffered from flatterers, it was not my fault. I have
more reason to be angry with you, for throwing me away in so ssiameful a
manner, on wretches who fawned upon, and betrayed you, and laid so
many snares to entrap me. As to your last accusation, of my deserting you,
Ι may retort it with justice on yourself3 as you very well know that you

absolutely drove me away, and turned me headlong out os doors; when
