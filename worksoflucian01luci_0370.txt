O, to‘ally different.

If they all teach different things, but one of thern, Ι stiould imagine,

canberight.
H E R M O T I M U S·

Most certainly. L Y C I N U S

Pray then, my friend, when you first entered on philosophy, and so many
doors were open to it, what induced you to leave all the rest, and strike into
that of the Stoics, as the only right path which could lead you to the truth,
whilst all the others were only blind alleys, where you could find no paffage:
how could you discover this? You were not then, as you are now, a wife
man, or if you please, a half wise one, able tojudge so much better than

we vulgar people can. Answer me fairly, therefore, like such an ignora-
mus as you were at that time, and as Ι am now. '

HERMOTIMUS.
Ι do not rightly understand your question, friend LycinuS.

L Y C Ι N U S.

Surely there is nothing so puzzling in it; as there were many philosophers,
Plato, Ari-stotle, Antisthenes, Chryfipp'uS, one of your own family, Zeno,
and I know not how many others, what prevailed on you to contemn all the
rest, and fix on that philosophy, which you chose as the only good one3 did
the Pythian oracle decide in favour of the Stoic, and dire& you to it, as it
did r· Chaerephon, telling you it was the best? it generally persuades some

to embrace one, and some another, as knowing, 1 suppose, what is most
suitable to every man.
HERMOTIMUS.
That was not my reason, Lycinus, nor did l consult any god about it.

L Y C Ι N U S.
&Vas -it then that you thought the matter scarce worthy the interpofition

of divine wisdom, or that you imagined yourself sufficiently able to deter-

mine without it ?
H E R M Ο T 1 M U S.

Ireally thought so. L Y C I N U S

You will, therefore, be so kind as to inform me, by what means one may
at first sight distinguissi the true philosophy from all those that are false.
