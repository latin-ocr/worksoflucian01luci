THEFISHERMAN. 255

cules, without any thing of the hero, either in his voice or gait, and deli-
cate and enervated‚ under the massz of strength and valour, Helen and Poly-
xena, would never bear 'such base resemblances, and the victorious Hercules
would soon, with his club‚ destroy the hero, for thus ignominioussy making
a woman of him.

In the same manner, when I -saw you misrepresented, I could not bear
such shameful affiting3 to behold our apes thus putting on the appearance
of heroes3 to see them imitating the ass of n Cumae, who, putting on the
lion’s skin, and roaring dreadfully, thought he might pass among the Cu·
maeans for a real lion, till the stranger, who often had seen both, and could
distinguiffi one from the other, discovered, and drove him off with a good
threshing. But what appeared to me, O Philosophy, of all things most in-
tolerable, was, that when these men affited foolishly, wickedly', and unbe-
comingly, every body laid the blame on you, and immediately abused
Chrysippus, Plato, Pythagoras, or whatever philosopher’s name they had
assumed, or whose precepts they had pretended to adopt: from the bad
lives of these rnen, the world formed a resemblance of your's. Had you been
alive this would never have happened; but you were long since departed,
and these they every day saw living in a most ffiameful and dishonourable
manner3 thus you are accused with them, and brought under the same con·
demnation. These things I could not suffer; Iattacked them, therefore,
and endeavoured to discriminate you from each other3 and for this, instead
of thanking nie for it, you bring me to justice. W'ere Ι to see any of the
initiated dancing unseemly † out of his place, and revealing the mysteries
of the ξς goddesses, and, being incensed, should fall upon and reprove him,
would you call me implous? that would be the highest injustice. WVhen any

⁶ The as} of Cumae.] Curnae was an ancient town of Campania, in Italy, where Tully had a
seat, called Praedium Cumanum. Lucian here alludes to the known fable of the ass in thelion's
sitin, which we meet with in AEsop‚ who, however, has not, as 1 remember, honoured him so
far as to mention the place of his nativity.

† Out qfhisplace.] See Lucian’s Treatise on Dancing.

1 ‘The godde cs.] Ceres and Proserpine. Lucian here alludes to the Thesmophoria, or Feasts
of Ceres the Legissatress, celebrated every five years. Cicero calls them μιιςημα, and initia,
usually divided into the great and the little, the former in honour of Ceres, the latter of Pro„
serpine. The person who initiated to the mysteries, was called the hierophantes‚ or chief
priest‚ whose business, and whose alone it was, τοι Ελευσιηα ανοιξαι, i. e. to reveal the mystery
of Eleusis: he had likewise the title of mystagogus. 1f any person divulged the mysteries of
these sacred rites‚ it was accounted unsafe to abide under the same roof with him.
