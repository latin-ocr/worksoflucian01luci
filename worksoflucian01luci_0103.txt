Is he so nimble-fingered as to have learned the art of stealing in his mo-

If you were to hear him talk, you would be astonished at his humour and
volubility. He wants to be my deputy. Yesterday he challenged Cupid3
and, some how or other, tripped up his heels, and got the better of him. A
little after this, whilst Venus was embracing and praifing him for his νίξίῑο-

ry, he stole her cestus; and, as Jupiter was laughing at him, ran away with
his scepter, and if his thunder and lightning had not been rather too heavy,
and had too much fite, would have taken them into the bargain.

A lively boy, indeed !

And, what is more, he is a musrcian too.

Why do you imagine so?

He found a dead ᾗ· tortoise somewhere, and made a musical instrument of it3

and fitting pins to it, with a neck, and keys, and bow, and seven strings,
played upon it something so sweet and harmonious, as to raise envy even in
me, wh0, you know, in former times, was counted a tolerable harper.
Maia says, he never stays a night in heaven ; but, out of his superabundant
industry, wanders down to hell, and steals something from thence. He
has wings withal, and a†wand of most miraculous power, by virtue of

ἃ Tortofi.] Mercmy, as all the old poets tell us, first discovered the testudO, or lyre, with
seven strings. The old tale is, that after stealing some bulls from Apollo, he retired to a se—
cret grotto. Just as he was going in, he found a tortoise, which he killed, and, perhaps, eat
the flelh of it. As he was afterwards diverting himself with the Ihell, he was mightily pleased
with the noise it gave from its concavo figure3 and, poffibly, had been cunning enough to
find out, that a string pulled strait‚ and fastened at each end, when struck by the finger, made a
sort of musical found. He went immediately to work, and cut several strings out of the hides
he had stolen, and fastened them as tight as he could, to the (hell of the tortoise ; and in play-
ing with them, made a new kind of mufic, to divert himself in his retreat. This was the ori-
gin of the lyre. See Spencer’s Polymetis, Dial. 8. See also Dr. Burney’s Description of the
testudo, in his excellent History of Mufic, vol. Ι. p. 268.

ι ἦ· A wand.] This wand, according to some writers, was given to Mercury by Apollo, in mcss
change for a lyre. Its wonderful perfectioris are mentioned by Virgil,

T um virgam capit, hac animas ille evocat Orco
Pallentes, alias sub tristia tartara mittit.
