THE

DISINHERITED SON.

A young Man is renounced and cast off (fhr such is the literal Interpretation of the
VVord αποκηρυττομευος), by his Father (we are not told why or wherefoi·e); he goes
abroad and studies Phystc3 on his Return home, he finds his Father raving mad,
vgfits, and cures him; inconsequence of which he is taken in again, and they are
reconciled. T he Mother-in-law‚ being seized with Madness, the young Physt-

cian, though intreated by the Father, refuses to prestribe any Thing for her; he
is again cast off and banished: he then appeals to the Laws fiir Redreſs. This,
according to LUCIAN'S Commentators, and Title—MongerS, is the Snbjebi of the
Piece before us, which has as little Wt or Humour to recommend it as the Ty-
rant·Killer. Lucmn, the stipposed Author, was, we know, originally a Lawer,
though, sor Reafiins frequently hinted in his Works, he declined the Projeffion.
He might, however, have been applied to by the young Man to a'raw up this De·
senec, which may thus, with ſsime Degree of Probability be astribed to him. Af-
ter all, it is nothing more than a dry uninteresting Pleading before a Court ofJu-
dicatnre: we are not, therefore, to wonder at the Dullness of it.

N this prosecution of my father’s‚ O reverend judges, there is nothing
new or uncommon, nor is this the first time that he has been unreason-
ably incensed against me3 he is always ready to appeal to the laws, and
flies, as usual, to this tribunal : my missortune is, indeed, singular and ex-
traordinary, because, guiltless as [arn myself, I must suffer for the imper·

fection of the art which I profess, if it doth not implicitly obey his corn-
mands. Can any thing bc more absurd and ridiculous than to expect I can

cure, not as far as my art will permit me, but as certainly, and as often as
he defires me ? Would to heaven 1 could boast of a medicine that could cure
men, not only when they were mad, but when they were angry without a
cause! then might 1 eafily remove my father's disorder. His madness is
undoubtedly gone off, but his paffion is more furious, and, which is worst
of all, he seems in his senses to every body else, and only rages against me,
who had relieved him. You see how 1 am rewarded for it, by a second
banishment from his house and family, as if I was only called back for a ihort

time, to be doubly disgtaced by another cruel rejeffion.
