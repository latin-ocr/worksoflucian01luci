principal thing to be called learned and philosophical, and will make verses
little inferior to Sappho ! for this purpose they procure rhetorician5‚ gram-
marians, and philosophers‚ and with these all their leisure hours are spent.
It often happens that whilst the philosopher is reading, the ἦ maid brings
a letter from the gallant, the lee‘cure upon wisdom and chastity stands still
till the lady has answered the epistle, and then they return to it with all
poffible expedition; when at last, after a considerable length of time, a
present is made you, at the † Saturnalia, or ‡ Panathenaica, of a half-worn-
out robe. Then a most grand and pompous ceremony begins : the first man
who heard his master, whilst he was doubting whether he should give it
you or not, runs before to give you notice, and must not go back without a
good fee3 in the morning ten or a dozen come to bring it you, and every
one boasts how much he has said in your favour, how warmly he enforced
it, and how he chose the best he could for you3 all these must be paid for
their trouble, and will grumble, moreover, that you did not give thern

If your reward isin money, you will be paid by little and little, perhaps

two or three oboli at a time; and if you ask for it, you are troublesome
and impertinent: you must beg, pray‚ and flatter3 pay your court to the
steward too, for this is another species of adulation which you must submit
to, nor must his intimate friend and counsellor be neglei'ted : and after all,
the whole, perhaps, when you have received it, is due to the taylor, the
ffioemaker, or the phyfician. Surely ᾗ gists like these are no gists, and of
very little service. In the mean time, some lie is raised against you to your
patron, who is ready to believe every thing3 he pcrceives now that you are
worn out by perpetual toils, perform your duty but lamely, sall off in your
strength, and, perhaps, sside by degrees into the gout3 and after he has en-
joyed the flower of your age, and exhausted your powers, when your body
and your coat are both worn out, looks about for some dunghill to throw you
