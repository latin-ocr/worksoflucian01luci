HERMOTIMUS. 3²9

HERMOTIMUS. ,
'Yes : a'n hour, a minute, the least particle of time is enough for me.
’ L Y c 1 N u S.
But how do you know whether the things above, for which you suffer all
· this, are in truth such bleffings, and can impirt such happiness, when you
were never there yourself, to experience them?

HERMOTIMUS.
I trust to what my* master tells me3 he has got to the summit, and knows

itan.
LYCINUS.

By the godS, then, Ι intreat you, my friend, inform me, what says he?
how do they live there, and in what does their happiness confist? ‘in riches,
glory, or pleasures the most exquisite Ρ

Α HERMoTrMUS.
“ Talk more soberly, dear Lycinus‚ a life of virtue has nothing to do with

such things as these.
L Y C 1 N U S.

If these are not, what says he are the rewards of all their labour?

HERMOTIMUS.

Wisdom, fortitude, the beautiful, the just, the consciousness of knowing
how every thing 1s conduc‘ted3 but riches, glory, pleasures, every thing
corporeal, every thing terrestrial, are left here below, and the man, like Her-

cules, who perished in the flames on mount Oeta, becomes a God ; he, we
know, shook off all that was mortal, all that he inhesited from his mother,

and, purged of his dross by fire, put on pure uncorrupt divinity, and ssed

to the gods: thus also it is that these purified by philosophy, as it were by
fire, look down upon all those things which others hold in admiration, and,

. raised to the summit, live a lise of happiness, without even the leastoremem-
brance of riches, glory, or pleasures, laughing at and contemning all such

as esteem or value them.
L Y C 1 Ν U S.

'Now, by AEtian Hercules, I swear, Hermotimus, most wonderful must
be their fortitude, and great their fericity3 but, pray, inform me of one
thing3 may they come down from the mountain, if they please, and
enjoy those things at any time which they left behind them; or are they
obliged, when they are once got up, to remain there with virtue, and to

despise riches and pleasures?
