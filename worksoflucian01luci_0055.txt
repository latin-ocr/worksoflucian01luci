NIGRINUS. 19

against the laws, by his appearance in such a habit on that occafion, they
unanimoussy acquitted him, because it was the only garment which he
had. He took occasion at the same time to extol the liberty which they en-
joyed in their retreat, their manner of living, free from envy and ambition;
their fiafety‚ ease, and happiness, with all the virtues that accompanied it,

and justice, modesty, and virtue are no more: bereft of these, the
mind becomes dry and barren, or only teerns with savage and bru-
tal extravagance. Such, according to his description, is this great city,
and such the leffons of instruction to be learned from her. “ When

of Rome or Athens, would serve, with very little alteration, for our own corrupted capital.
Compare this with the tenth satire of Juvenal, and Dr. Samuel J0hns0n’s excellent imitation

of it, in his poem called London.
