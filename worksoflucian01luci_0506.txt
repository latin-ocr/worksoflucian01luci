and disturbs, and by degrees, drives them to madness. Many things throw
women into this distemper, particularly a violent hatred against any one,
the envy of a happy rival, or any grief or paffion. These lying hid under
the ashes, as it were, for a long time, at length break forth into open in-

sanity.

Thus, my father, it happened to your wife ε some missortune was, per-
haps, the cause of her disorder; {he hated no body ι she was seized, how-
ever, with it, nor can ssre be cured by any medical art or skill. If any body
else will ever pretend to this, or ever free her from it, then hate and abhor
me as the author of all. Nor even, if her case was not so desperate, and there
were some hopes of her recovery, would 1 venture to prescribe any thing for
her, =for fear of being reflected on ifI did not succeed. It is universally re·
ceived, that step-mothers have an invincible hatred of their sons-in-law, how
good soever they may be; they all rage, as it were, with one common fe-
male fury. If it turns out ill, therefore, and the medicine is not powerful
enough, people may suspe& that there was something unfair and malevolent
in the application of it. Such is the condition of your wife, that were she to
take a thousand potions, she would be never the better for thern3 it is to no
purpose, therefore, to administer any thing to her, nor would you advise
me to it, unless with a view, if Ι fail, of drawing infamy upon me. Let me,
I beseech yon, still be the object of envy amongst my brethren : if, in ssiort,
after all, you should again banissi me, and Ishould be deserted by all, I will
nor curse you. lf your distemper {hould return, which heaven forbid! but
these disorders‚ when irritated, are too apt to return, how should l then act?
Iwill then, you may depend on it, again most certainly cure you ε for never
willI forget that duty which nature has enjoined, nor be unmindful of my
family ; and if 1 should again restore you, doubtless you would again receive
me. Whilst, therefore, you are doing these thing5‚ and thus prosecuting
me, you invite the disease, and, as it were, anticipate the evil. Recovered
but three days fince from that dreadful calamity, you again cry out, are
again enraged against me, and again appeal to the laws. Aias! ‘my father,
such were the fore-runners of your former insanity.
