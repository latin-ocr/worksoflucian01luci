WRITINGS oi· 1111011113. xvii

fion, wit and humour, instead of your’s: nothing, 33 it has
been observed by one of our best critiCS, 13 so grave 33 true
humour (and almost every line of Lucian is a proof of it) ;
it never laughs itself, whilst it sets the table in a roar3 a
circumstance which these gentlemen seem all to have for--
gotten: instead of those set featureS, and serious aspee‘t,
which you always wear when most entertaining, they pre—
sent us for ever with a broad grin, and if you have the least
smile upon your countenanoe, make you burst into a vul-
gar horse-laugh : they are generally, indeed, such bad
painterS, that the daubing would never be taken for you,

if they had not written Lucian under the pi&ure.' I hear-
tily wilh the Docstor better luok. ’

LUCIAN.

And there is some reason to hope it: forI hear he has
taken pains about me, 1133 studied my features well before
he sat down to trace them on the canvaS, and done it, CON
AMORE: if he brings out a good resemblance, I 111311 ex-
cuse the want of grace and beauty in his piece. I affure you
Ι 3111 not without pleafing expetf‘tati0n3 especially as my
friend Sophocles, wlm, you know, sat to him some time
agO, tells me, though he is no Praxiteles, he does not take
a bad likenesS.—-But Ι must be gone, for yonder 6011163 Swift
and RabelaiS, whom I have made a little party with this
morning: s0, my good Lord, fare you well.

LoRD LYTTELToN.
And I must meet my dear Lucy in the myrtle grove 3 s0,
honest Lucian, good morrow to yon.
