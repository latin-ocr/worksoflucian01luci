SI never, in a public capacity, received any obligatIOns from the
A people of Agrigentum, or, in a private one, from Phalaris himself;

it cannot be supposed that my interest biaffed me in their behalf, or the
hopes ‘of his future friendship prejudiced me in his favour. But having
heard the ambafl'adors, who, in the name of their sovereign, ask that of
you, which Ι cannot but think entirely just and reasonable; from a fincere
regard, therefore, to piety and the public good, and, above all, as becomes
a priest of Delphos, I rose up with a defign to exhort you, in the strongest
manner Ι am able, by no means to contemn the piety of the prince, or to
alienate a gift defigned as an offering to Apollo; and especially as it will be
an everlasting testimony of these three things, the wickedness of the iuven

tor, the mcompar ‚able excelleney of his art, and thejustice of his punish-

ment. Your doubts concerning the manner in which you should proceed, and
the proposal, made by the magistrates, to deliberate whether the offering
should be received or sent back, I look upon as impious 3 or rather, in truth‚
as the height of impiety3 little less, in effect, than sacrilege itself, the most
heinous of all crimes: for to deny those, who are willing to offer up gifts,
'the power of doing it, is the same thing as to rob the temple of such as are
already offered. Let me, therefore, who, as I am myself a Delphian, have
an equal share with you in the public honour, if preserved3 and equal loss
and infamy, if it be forfeited3 beseech you not thus to drive the good and
pious from our doors, and lay open our city to the calumnies of ill men,
who will not fail to report, that whatever gifts are brought must be subje&ed
to ourjudgment and inspection ; and who will offer presents, when they are
affured that nothing will be accepted by Apollo, unless it be first examined
int0, ancl approved of by the Delphians? But, in regard to the gift before
us, our god harh, 1 think, himself sufficiently testified his approbation of it3
for had he detested the tyrant, and abhorred his present, how easy had it

been
