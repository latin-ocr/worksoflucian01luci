THE

FISHERMAN,

ADIALOGUE.

‘she excellent Satire of the preceding Dialogue, apparently aimed at the false Philo-

prhers of Antiquigy, who, to speak in the Language of Scripture, profeffing
themselves to be wise, became F ools, had sb alar-med the whole indignant Race,
that theyfell upon Lum AN, we moy suppose, as the Heroes of the Dunciad did
on Pope, with no small Degree of Acrimorqy and Rcss’ntment. In the following
Answer to their Accusations, he defends himself in such a Mamer, as must con-
vince every impartial Reader, that he was an Enemy, not to true, but false}
Philofhpiy. This Dialogue is called the F1SHERMAN, from a very laugh-
able Circumstance, introduced towards the End of it. The whole abounds with
good Sense, Wt, and Humour.

SOCRATES.

ELT, pelt the rascal with stones upon stones; at him again with clods;
P cover him with ihells, bruise him with staves: do not let him get
away from you: at him, Plat0; at him, Chryfippu53 and you, and you:
let us make a phalanx of ihields, and fall upon him all together:

θ(- Let staves on staves‚ on pouches pouches fall,
Each strengthen each, and all encourage all.

He is our common enemy, and there is not one of us whom he hath not
abused. Now, Diogenes, if ever, use your club, and do not spare him:
let the blasphemous wretch suffer the punishment he has deserved :

† Now call to mind your ancient trophies won,
Your great forefathers’ virtues, and your own.

In tribes, and natione, to divide thy nain,

His separate troops, let every reader call,

Each strengthen each, and all encourage all.
