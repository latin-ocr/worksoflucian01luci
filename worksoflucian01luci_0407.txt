else, 1 have fulfilled my duty, and, if you will come to me to·morrow
morning, you shall see how he can ask questions and answer them, how
many things he has learned, and how many books he has read, about
axioms‚ and syllogisms, and comprehensionS, and duties, and a thousand
other things. If he beat his mother, and debauched a girl, what is that to
me? I am not his tutor.

Thus did the old man talk about philosophy3 and you, Ι suppose, will
tell us, thatall we are to expe& from this noble science is, that we {hall be
never the worse for it : is it really so, my friend, or had we formed better
hopes from it; did we not expe& to become a little better than idiots by
it? What say you to this ?

HERMOTIMUS.

Ι can only say, my friend, that I am ready to cry when Ι think what a
fool Ι have been, so throughly am l at last convinced by sense and reason : I
lament my folly, in throwing away so much time to no purpose. Ι am
like a man just recovered from a fit of drunkenness„ I see, with shame,

There is no reason, however, to cry about it; AEsop’s advice, in one of

his fables, iS, Ithink, a most excellent one : he tells us of a man, who was

of the waves that are gone, but begin and number those before you.
Do you, therefore, since you are convinced of your error, for the fu-
ture be content to live like other men, be a good common citizen, aad

aim at nothing great or fingular3 if you are wife, do not be ashamcd, old as
⁷ you are, of changing for the better.

Do not imagine, my good friend, whatever Ι may have said, that I had
any enmity against the Portico, or meant to affront the Stoics in particu-
lar3 my argument holds, equally, against every sedi, andI should have
said the very same thing, if you had been a Platonist, or an Aristotelian.
