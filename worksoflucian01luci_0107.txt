son of Jove, by incessant toil and labour, purged the world of crimeS, sub-
dued monsters, and took revenge on proud and impious men; whilst you
were nothing but a simplet· and a mountebank : your medicines might, per-
haps, be serviceable to a few fick mortals; but you never performed any thing

greatormanly. AE S C U L A Ρ I U S

True ; for I cured your burns when you came to me half roasted‚ with
a body which the ffiirt and flames together had almost consumed. If I did
nothing else, however, I was not a ssave, neither did 1 put on a purple gar-
ment and turn spinster in Lydia3 nor was 1 beaten by Omphale with a gol-
d'en distaff 3 neither did I run mad, and kill my wife and children.

H E R C U L E S.

Hold your abufive tongue‚ or you shall find your immortality of little ser-
vice, for Iwill throw you down headlong out of heaven, and crack your
pate in such a manner, that Paeon himself shall not be able to heal it.

J U P 1 T E R.

nish you both from the banquet. Hercules, AEsculapius must fit down be-
fore you‚ for he ἦ died first.

A P O L L O, what makes you so melancholy.
A P O L L Ο.

Misfortunes in love.
M E R C U R Y.

That, indeed, is enough to make you so: but how are you unhappy,
does Daphne’s fate affliet you still?
A P O L L Ο.
Νο; but 1 lament the lovely son of Oebalus.
M E R C U R Y.
Is Hyacinthus dead ?

²4 Diedfirst,] This is an odd title to superiority. Amongst the heathen demi-godS, precedency,
it seem5‚ went not by birth, as with men, but by death: according to our adage, first cone

first served.
