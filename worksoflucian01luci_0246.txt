· Those, Charon, are Hope, Fear, Pleasure‚ Folly, Love of Money,

Anger, Hatred, 'and the rest of the paflions‚ which are mingled· together,
and seattered amongst men, without their knowlege3 and in the same city
you will find them all. 'Fear fiies alost, and then descending, strikes ter-
ror and amazement into their hearts. Hope, in like manner, hovers over
their heads, and, whilst every man eagerly catches at it, fiies away, and
leaves the fools gaping with open mouths behind: just as you have seen
Tantalus served in the> infernal regions. But, if you look narrowly, you
may observe the Parcae above, turning some spindles with ssender threads
hanging down over the heads of every one of thern, like spider’s webs. Δ

You do s03 and the reason is, because the Fates have decreed that one

should be killed by one, and another by another. He whose thread is long-

who has a still longer than himself3 their being entangled together forebodes
something of this kind. You see what a ssender thread they all hang by;

behold him n ho is so exalted above the rest: in a very short time he shall
sind himself une-qual to the weight he sustains, the cord will break, and
he shall fall with a mighty noise: the oth,er who is raised but a little way
from the earth, shall drop infilenee, and even his nearest neighbour shall

searce hear hisv fall.

O, it ’ is impoffible to say how ridieul ous these mortals are : mark their
care and solicitude, and observe how suddenly death lays hold on them; see
what a heap of ministers he has, Agnes, Fevers, Consumptions, Peripneu-
monies, Sword, Poison‚ Thieves, Judges, and Tyrants; and yet not -one

of these do they ever think on whilst they are in prosperity3 but, when afflic-
tion comes upon them, then it is, O me ! and alack, and alas 1 Whereas,

if they had c0nfi‹.1e1-ed in early youth that they were but mortals, doomed to
wander
