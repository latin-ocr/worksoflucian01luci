And so he lays in instead of her.

Even so, Neptune, as absurd as it may appear to you. Juno came ssily
over her (you know how jealous ssie is), and persuaded her to reqnest of

Jupiter that he would come to her with all his thnnder and lightnicg about
him. She listened to her advice3 and when Jove came, his lightning set
the house on fire, and burned Semele in the midst of it. He ordered me at
the same time to take the child ont of her, for she was seven months gone,
and bring it to him, which Idid, and he immediately put it into 'his thigh,
and kept it till the proper time of its birth; and now, the other ⁴* three
months being elapsed, he is brought to bed of it, and is very weak and

languid after his labour.

DIALOGUE XXVII.

JUPITER AND‘JUNO.

U N O.
SIN CE you brought up thatJPhrygian boy from mount Ida, you take no

notice of me.

θ ‘Three months,] My author, if 1 understand him aright, seems here to bea little out in
his reckoning. He tells us, a few lines above, that the child was, το Εμξςυοιέπταμηιαιον, a
seven months child, consequently the mother was, as 1 have transsated it, seven months gone,
and now he says, Τριτω μηνί ege-tvm αυτο, three months afterwards Jupiter brought him forth ;
so that this extraordinary child was ten months getting into the world; which, Ι believe, is
rather longer than usual. l know not how to reconcile this, but suppofing that by Επταμηιαιοι,
Lucian meant that Semele was just entered into the seventh month of her pregnancy 3 how to
make sense of it any other way is, Ι must own, to make use of a midwife’s phrase on this sub=

ἂεᾶ, past my conception.
