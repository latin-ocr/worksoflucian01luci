TIMON. 35

it themselveS, but that they could prevent others from making any of it;
like the dog in the manger, who would neither eat the corn himself, nor
suffer the hungry horse to feed upon it. How you used to laugh at those
that carked and spared3 and, what was most ridiculous, were jealous even
of themselves! little thinking that a wicked servant, a steward, or their
children’s tutor, might corne privately, rob them of their all, and then
laugh at the poor miserable master, wh0, perhaps, was fitting by his
dingy lamp, brooding over his imaginary treasure. How absurd is it in
you, who used to talk in this manner, now to rail at Timon l

PLUTUS.

If you would take the pains, notwithstanding, to enquire into the truth,
you would find I was right in both: for Timon's extravagance‚ with re-
gard to me, was not benevolence, but folly; and as to those who lock me
up in darknesS, and take so much pains to make me fatter and bigger, and
swell me to an immense fize, and, at the same time, never touch me
themselves, nor bring me to the light, for fear I should be seen by others,
1 look upon them as madmen3 and think they treat me very ill, who never
did thern any harm, when they let me grow mouldy in prison, without
confidering how soon Ι may leave them, and go away to some other of
Fortune‘s favourites. WVherefore Ι neither commend them, nor such as
part from me too eafily3 but those only, who, observing the true medium,
neither totally abstain from, nor entirely devour me. For I would ask you,
Jupiter, whether if a man were to marry a young and beautiful wife, and
afterwards should never watch or be jealous of her, but give her leave to
go wherever she would, night and day, and keep company with whom she
pleased‚ nay‚ should open his doors, invite every body in, and expose her
to prostitution‚ would you believe this man loved her? You, who know
what love is, could never think it: or if a man takes a fine blooming
girl home, in order to have children by her, and then never touches her,
nor permits any body else so much as to look at her3 himself, at the same
time, a poor emaciated wretch, with his eyes sunk in his head, and yet
pretending to be fond of her3 would not you call such a fellow mad, who,
instead of enjoying the pleasures of matrimony, should let a sueet and
beautiful creature pi ue away her whole life in virginity, like a priesteis

of Ceres ? And have not I the same reason to complain, who am kicked and
F 2 cuffed,
