M E R C U R Y.
By no means, friend; for he seems to have something rich about him,

so that you would be no loser by the purchase : befides, he can tell you how

long a flea lives, to what depth the sea is lighted by the sun, and what sort
of soul oysters have. B I D D E R

ὅ· Double charafler] Alluding to Aristotle’s τες λογες εσωτεξικους τες dianna-meg, εξωτεμκες τως
§ni-opium, the doctrine of Aristode, we are told, was of two kinds, exoteric, and acroatic : undev
the fi'st were ranked rhetoric, meditation‚ nice disputes on the knowledge ofcivil things; under

the other, the more remote and l'ubtle philosophy, the contemplation of nature, and dialeffive„
disceptations. See Stanley’s Life ofAristotle.

† Summum bonum] Aristode held that the summum bonum, or greatest poffible beatitude,

confisted in the funciion of perfect life, according to virtue ς and the use of virtue, according
to nature, without any impediment.
