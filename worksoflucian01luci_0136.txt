-U P I T E R.
So, it seems, you are jeJalous of that fimple' lad, who, Iam sure, has
no harm in him. 1 thought you were only uneasy about the women that

kept company with me. q
J U N O.

You ought to be ashamed of that ε it ill becomes the king of the gods to-
leave his lawful wife, and go down to earth to play the fool in the shape of
a bull, ora bit ofo gold. The w,omen however, stay below, but this boy,
lror 1 Ida, is brought up here to live with us, to be put over my h ad, and
to be your cup- -,bearer it seems. XVere you so much 1n want of one ? Are
Hebe and Vulcan tired of their office? But his kiffes are sweeter than the
nectar, and you are always tasting one for the sake of the other, and 1n the
sight of every body: I have seen you take the cup from him, and kiss the
brim where he drank; lay by your aegis and your thunder, and fit playingv
with him, you with your long beard, the king of gods and men: do not
flatter yourself that you are undiscovered, for I have been an eye-witness
of it.

And where was the harm of it? If Ι would let him kiss you, you would

not com plain

You talk like what you are: do you think I would permit a Phr ygian boy
to have any thing to say to me?

U P Ι T E R.
No 1·efle6²tions on my tastJe, Ι delire, for I think him —- but I will say

no more,

l wilh you had married him instead of me. 1 am sure you have affronted
me osten enough on his account.

U P 1 Τ Ε R.
You would have your sonjvulcan, I suppose, in his place, hopping about,

coming red hot from his furnace, with the ashes all over him, to give us the
cup out of his black fingers, and have me kiss those sooty lips, which even⁴
you, who are his mother, cannot touch ε a pretty cup-bearet for the feast of‘
the gods. Ganymede, in the mean time, must be sent back to Ida, be·-
cause he is neat aud clean, has rosy fingers, and hands the cup about most
dexteroussy: and, what to you is worse than all, has sweet lips.
