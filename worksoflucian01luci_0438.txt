write, therefore, whatI have seen, and not what I have heard ;’' he saw
every thing so extremely well, that he tells υς, “ the Parthian dragons
(which amongst them 'e' fignifies no more than a great number, for one dra-
gon brings a thousand), are live serpents, of a prodigious fize, that breed in
Perfia, a little above Iberia3 that these are lifted up on long poles, and
spread terror to a great distance3 and that when the battle begins, they let
them loose on the enemy.'’ Many of our soldiers, he tells ua, were devour-
ed bythem, and a vast number preffed to death by being locked in their
embraces: this he beheld himself from the top os a high tree, to which he
had retired for safety. Well it was for us that he so prudently determined
not to come nigh thern, we might otherwise have lost this excellent writer,
who with his own brave hand performed such feats in this battle: for he
went 'through many dangers, and was wounded some where about Susa, 1
suppose, in his journey from Cranium to Lerna. All this he recited to the
Corinthiam, who very well knew that he had never so much as seen a view
of this battle painted on a wall; neither did he know any thing of arms, or
military machinos, the method of dispofing troops, or † even the proper
names of them. ⁶

Another famous writer has given an account of every thing that paffed,
from beginning to end, in Armenia, Syria, Mesopotamia, upon the Tigris,
and in Media, and all in less than five hundred lines, and when he had done
this, tells us, he has written a history3 the title, which is almost as long as
the work, runs thus, “ a narrative of every thing done by the Romans in
Armenia, Media, and Mesopotamia, by Antiochianus, who gained the
prize in the sacred games of Apollo.'’ 1 suppose, when he was a boy, he
had conquered in a running match.

I have heard of another likewisc, who wrote the history of what ᾗ was to
happen hercafter, and describes the taking os Vologesus prisoner, the mur-
ther of Osrocs, and bow he was to be given to a li0n3 and above all, our

³¹* Sigmfies, ξῖικ] Dragons, or fiery serpents, were used by the Parthians, and Suidas tells us,
by the Scythians also, as standards, in the same manner as the Romans made use of the eagle‚
and under every one of these standards were a thousand rnen. See Lips. de Mil. Rom. cap. 4.

ἶ Is'as to haspra] The idea here so deservedly laughed at, of a history os what was to come,
is treated, not i'e1·i‹›;isly, as this absurd writer treated it, but ludicroussy, as Lucian would pro-
bably have treated. it himself, might open a fine field for wit and humour. Something of this
kind appeared in a news-paper a few years ago, which, [ think, was called News for a hundred
Ycars bence3 and though but a rough merch, was well executed ; a larger work, on the same
gro-and, and by a good hand, might afford much entertainment.
