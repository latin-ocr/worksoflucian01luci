was strewed with swords and prongS, and close to us were three rivers, one
os mire, another of blood, and another of fire, immense and unpaffable, that
fiowcd in torrents, and rolled like waves in the sea: it had many fifh in it,
some like torches, others resembling live coals; which they called lychnisci.
There is but one entrance into the three riverS, and at the mouth of them
stood, as porter, Timon of Athens. By the affistance‚ however, of our
guide, Nauplius, we proceeded‚ ancl saw several ᾗ punished, as well kings
as private persons, and amongst these some of our old acquaintance: we
saw wi« Cinyrus, hung up by a certain part, and roasting there. Our guides
gave us the history of several of them, and told us what they were punished
sor: those, we observed, suffered most severely, who in their life-times had

“ told lies, or written what was not true, amongst whom were Ctesias the Cni-

dian, Herodotus, and many others. When I saw these Ibegan to con-

ieave of Nauplius, and returned to our ship. In a short time after we had
a view, but confused and indistinssc, os the Issand of Dreams, which itself
was not unlike a dream, for as we approached towards it, it seemed as it
were to retire and fly from us. At last, however, we got up to it, and en-
tered the harbour, which is called 5, Hypnus, near the ivory gates, where
there is a harbour dedicated to the § cock. We landed late in the evening,
and saw several dreams of various kind. I propose, however, at present, to
gire you an account of the place itself, which no body has- ever written:
about, except Homer, whose description is very imperfeffi‘t.

Round the issand is a very thick wood3 the trees are all tall poppies, or*
