,THE A P¹ O L 0:.G Y. 323

is of a very different nature3 in private 1 amas free as ever, and in public
have ²* no small concern in a most powerful empire‚ and bear a part in the

administration of it. You will please to consider, that it is in a great mea-
* sure committed to my care, to preside over, and regul-ate the courts ofjudica-
Ι ture, write over the records, digest and put in order the specchesos the pleaders‚
preserve, with care ,and accuracy, the edicts of the emperor, and faith-
fully deliver them down to posterity; add to this, that my salary is paid me
>by no private man, but by the prince himself3 that it is no mean one, but
confists of many talents; there are, withal, good expectatione, and those
very probable, of something still better, some royal commands to be perform-
ed by me, or, perhaps, the whole nation committed to my care and in·
uspeffion.

But, not content with refuting the accusation, I will golstill farther, and
venture to assert, that no man does any thing without being paid forL it.
Those who are employed in the highest offices need not be named, when
even the emperor has his reward3 for, not to mention the annual taxes and
tribures which he receives from the people‚ thehonours, praises‚ and adora·
tion, which are paid him in return for his beneficence, with the statues and
temples ere&ed to him, what are they but so many rewards for his providena
tial care, and advancement of the public welfare! To compare great things
with small, therefore, take any particle of the large heap from the top to the
bottom‚ and you will find that there is no difference between us, except that
some are great and some little ; but all equally mercenary.

If, indeed, I had said that nobody should do any thing at all, Ι might
justly be accused of contradi&ing my own precepts; but there is no such
thing in my book : on the other hand, every good man, I say, should labour:
andro what can he better apply himself than to be useful to his friends,
placed as heis in this world on purpose to give proofs of his diligence, fide·

lity‚ and attention to the business and employment allotted to him, that he
may not, as Homer says,

ψ Live an idle burthen to the ground,

θ’ No small concern] We cannot exaffly determine what Lucian’s employment under the em-
peror was; some call him intendant of Egypt, others governor, steward‚ &c. We find at least

by his ovivn testimony, that it was a place of considerable honour, and we may suppose very pro-
fitable al o.
