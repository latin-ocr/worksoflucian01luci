sulting from it that deserves so rnuch toil and trouble? How little time is
left for enjoyment, when you are grown old and no longer able to relissi such
pleasures, with one foot, as they say, in the ‘³4' grave! unless, indeed, you
are looking forward to another life, and are learning here how to live better

knowing that though, as they say, he beat his heart out, the water will be
water still. But let me ask you one question 3 would you wilh to resemble
your master in any thing, his learning excepted? to be, like him, a pallion-
ate, sordid, and litigious voluptuary? for ΓΟ, by Jupiter, he is, though the
world in general do not know it.
