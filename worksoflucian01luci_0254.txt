218 ONSACRIFICES.

they feasted him, and the rest of the gods whom he carried along with him,
for twelve days, Thus, nothing, it should seem, of all they do, will they do
without being paid for it, but sell all sorts of good things to mankind : one,

riches for four oxen; a third purchases a kingdom with a hecatomb3 for

chased the redemption of Troy, of Minerva, for twelve oxen, and a fine
garment. Many things, however, we must suppose will corne cheaper, and
rnay be bought os them for a cock, a garland, or even a little common in-
cense. For this reason, I suppose, Chryses, the high-priest, an old man,
and well {killed in divine matters, after his unsuccessful attack on Agamem-
non, expostulates with Apollo, whom he had bribed high for his favour,

But thou, aton’d‚ by penitence and prayer,

Ourselves, our infants‚ and our city spare! Pope’s Transsadon.
