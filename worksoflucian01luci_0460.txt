nothing but what is true.

To return to our voyage W e took our leave of the king and his friends,

got on board our strip, and set sail. Endymion made me a present of two ·
glass robes, two brass ones, and a whole coat of armour made of lupmes,
31 which I left m the ἦ w'hale 3 belly. He likew 1se sent with us a thousand

Hippogypi, who escorted us five hundred stadia.

We sailed by several places, and at length reached the new colony of the
‘Morning-star, where we landed and took in water : from thence we steered
into the Zodiac, leaving the Sun on our left, we paffed close by his territory,
and would have gone ashore, many of our companions'being very defirous of
it; but the wind would not permit us: we had a view, however, of t'hat
region, and perceived that it was green, fertile, and well-watered, and
abounding in every thing neceffary and agreea‘ble. The NephelocentaurS,
who are mercenaries in the service of Phaeton, saw us and flew aboard our

have. Vl e heard them speak: they offered us no injury, but invited us in
the most hospitabl e manner3 we were afraid, notwithstanding3 neither
would any of us venture to take any food or sseep. The king-‘⁹ s court is in
the middle of the city: here he sits 311 night, calls every one by name, and
if they do not appear, condemns them to death for deserting their post: their
death is, to ‘be put out: we stood by, andheard several of thern plead their
excuses for non-attendance. Here l found my own lamp, talked to him, and
asszed him *how things went on at home ε 116 told me every thing that had
