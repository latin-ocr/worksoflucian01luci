274 THEFISHERMAN.

PARRHESIADES.
Here comes a fine broad ‘⁴⁶ flat-fissi, that looks as if he was cut inm).

he gapes at the hook like a sparrow 3 he has swallowed it, we have him, ι

draw him up; who is it?
D Ι 0 G E N E 8.

He calls himself a Platonic.
P L A T Ο.

What, do you bite at the gold? rascal.
PARRHEstADEQ
W⁷ell‚ Plato, what {han we do with him?
P L A Τ 0.

Throw him down the same rock.

D Ι O G E N E S.

Come, now, let down your hook for another.

PARRHESIADES.

Yonder is a beautiful one coming, one may see him quite at the bottome,
spotted all over with various colours‚ and scales of gold upon his back : seer
there: O this is an Aristotelian ι here he comem, now he swims back again t
observe him carefully3 he is returned, he bites, he is> caught: pull him up.

A R Ι S T O T L E.
Do not ask me about the fellow, 1 know nothing of him,

PARRHESIADESs
Then 1 shall down with him after the others.
D Ι Ο G E N E S.
See, see, yonder is a heap of them together, all of the same colour,
prickly, monstrous ugly‚ and harder to catch than † crab-fifh. We must:
have a drag-net for them; but there is never a one at hand ε well, let us

catch one, that will be sufficient: the boldest of them, perhaps, will bite.

E L E N C H U S,
Let down your line, but you had better cover it first with iton, or they

will snap it in two with their teeth.

³* Flat-fish.] Lucian calls it, ο mom-vg, platys, which he meant for another pun, as bordet-
iug on Plato. The fiih alludded to was, probably,‘ what the Germans call halbesche. With=
us, 1 believe, it goes by the name ofa hollybutt, not unlike a turbot.

† Crab-fi'sh.] The echinus, or erinaceus. Lucian says they are prickly, alluding to the
thoi-ny subtleties of the Stoics. Severitatem δι spinosas Stoicorum subtilitates carpit, says the
commentator.
