ONDEPENDANT& 315

'And now Ῑ could wish to set before you, in the manner of ἧς’ Cebes, an

exa& image or picture of this kind of life, that you might carefully observe
and consider whether you would choose to enter into it. W'ould Ι could meet
with an Apelles or Parrhafius, an AErion or Euphranor, to paint it for
me! but fince none can now be found poffeffed of their skill and genius, 1
will give you a ssight lketch of my own, and do my best sor you. † Ima-
gine then a lofty palace, not low on the earth, but raised on an eminence far
above it, covered with gold ε let the ascent to it be long, steep, and ssippery,
so that those who hoped they had just reached the summit, frequently ssip
down andfa113 within let Plutus be seated, all over gold, beautiful and
lovely : the candidate with difficulty reaches the gatte, and gazes on the trea-
sures3 Hope, in full beauty‚ and cloathed in a garment of divers colours,
leads him on, aud he is soon received by two females, Fraud and Slavery,
who deliver him over to the hands os Labour3 by him he is well disciplined,
and paffed on to Old Age: he grows fick‚ and his colour changes3 then
comes lnfmny, seizes on, and leads him to Despair; Hope, from that mo-
ment vanishes‚ and is seen no more : he retireS, not through the golden gate
which he entered at, but by a narrow private paffage, naked, pot-belly’d,
pale, and worn out with age; with one hand covering his nakedness, with
the other endeavouring to throttle himself: as he goes out he is met by Re.
pentance, weeping in vain, and only making the wretched more unhappy:
this finishes the picture.

And now, my good Timoeles, examine the whole, and think within your-=
self, whether you would wilh to enter on such a life, through the first gare, if
you were obliged to go out so shamefully at the latter. Whatever your de-
termination is, remember the wise man's saying,

,ἶ God is blameless, and the fault lies in our own choice.

’Ἀ Cebes] Alluding to the famous Tabula Cebetis, still extant, a transsation of which the
reader will meet with in Shaftesbury's Charaderistics ; see likewise the Spedlator, and an ele·
gant poem iu Dodssey's Colleffion.

ἦ· Ιιηαὲῐηε them] Lucian has here given us avery good. imitation of Cebes, in a beautiful

allegorical picture, which I should be glad to see executed on canvas by the masterly hand of
our Reynolds, West, or Angelica.

,ἶ God is, &cd See Plato's Republic.
