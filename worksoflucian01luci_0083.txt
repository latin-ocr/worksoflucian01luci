Stay a little only, and you may bring me in guilty of murther.
[Beats him again.
GNATHONIDES.
By no means; you need only heal my wounds, by sprinkling a little gold

upon them3 it is the best thing in the world for stopping the blood.

TIMON.

So you will stay here yet ?
GNATHONIDES.

Ι am gone, and a curse on you for changing from an honest fellow to such

asavage!

Who is this coming to us with his bald pate? O, it is that most villain-
ous of all flatterers, Philiades 3 he whom I gave a large piece of ground to,

and two talents for his daughter’s portion, for praifing my finging, when no
body else would, and swearing that Ι was more mufical than a swan : and

yet, afterwards, when Ι was fick the other day, and implored his affistance,
the wretch fell upon and beat me.

O impudence! now ye will know Timon again, now Gnathonides will
be his friend and companion: but he is rightly served for his ingratitude.
We, who are his old friends, countrymen, and playfellows, shall behave a
little more modestly, and not rush upon him with so much rudeness and in-
civility. Hail, my noble master ! take proper notice, I beseech you, of these
vile flatterers, who never come near but to devour you, like so many ravens3
but in this age there is no trusting to any body3 they are all base and un-
grateful. I was coming here to bring you a talent, to supply you with ne-

ceffaries‚ but was informed by the way that you have got riches in abundance
of your own: Icame on, however, to cautior: you against these people3

though you want, indeed, no such monitor as Ι am3 you, who are able to

give advice to Nestor himself.
T Ι M Ο N.

May be so: but pray come a little nigher, that 1 may compliment you

with my spade.
P H 1 L Ι Α D E S.

Friends, neighbours, help here ! this ungrateful man has broke my head,
only for giving him good advice.

TIMON.
