uncalled 2 1 did not, indeed, undertake to cure him immediately, for that
is not our custom, nor is it warranted by our art, which teaches us first to
confidet whether the disease is curable, or beyond the reach of medicine,
and then if it is fit to be taken in hand, with all diligence we enter upon ir,
and endeavour to save the patient: but if, on the other hand, we perceive
that the distemper has plainly got the better, and is insuperabie, we never
attempt any thing, observing the laws of the ancient masters in the science,
who say, that we should never touch the fallen. Seeing, however, that
there were still hopes of my father, and that his distemper was not yet be-
yond the limits of a poffible cure, after the most diligent attention, I boldly
poured in my medicines on him, though many who were present were very
doubtful of their efficacy, found fault with my method of cure, and seemed

at my success, and his recovery. With regard to himself, I must do him the
¹iustice to acknowlege, that as soon as he had heard what passed from those
about him, he immediately, of his own accord, recalled the banishment he
had inflicted on me, and took me back again as his son, and called me his
