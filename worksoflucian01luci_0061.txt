rather put them under their noses‚ that the smell might be stronger‚ and
more agreeable ς those, above all, did he turn into ridicule, who are so won-
derfully expett in grand entertainments, and perpetually employed in the
search of dainties and delicacies of every kind. They went through a deal
of trouble and fatigue, he said, to procure a short and momentary pleasure,
as scarce any man’s throat was above four fingers long; for neither before,
nor after, they had tasted this costly food, would it give them more satisfac·
tion than the plainest and cheapest diet3 purchafing, thus, a fleeting and
tranfitory pleasure, at a price the most extravagant; and all because they
wanted true taste, to enjoy that real and solid satisfaction, which philoso-

The next thing which he took notice of, was what paffed in the baths ;
· where the rich and great, with a large train of attendants, are carried on
the shoulders of their ssaves, as if laid out for their funeral. One absur-
dity, in particular, frequently pra6lised in these places, raised his indignation ε
servants walking before their masters, and crying out to them to ἦ· look to
their feet, and give them warning of every hillock, or puddle‚ in their

way, that they might know (which was to the last degree ridiculous) how
to walk safely. It was intolerable‚ he thought, to see people, who

never made use of other’s hands or mouths, to eat, or of other's ears
to hear, should, notwithstanding, when they were in full health and
vigour, borrow other men's eyes to see with, and suffer themselves to be
bawled to like the poor and blind; and yet the greatest men, and those to
whom the care of the state was committed, even in the middle of the day,
and in the public market-place‚ would submit to this indignity. With these,
and many other observations of the like nature, he finished his discourse.
I was lost in astonishment3 and listening still with attention, dreaded his
filence, when I perceived he had quite done. The same thing happened
to me, as did to the † Phaeacians of old; I stood a long time with my eyes
fixed on him : my head turned round, the sweat dropped from me, Ialmost

almost all the modes of Eastern luxury. ⁴
