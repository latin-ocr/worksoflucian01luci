* Λεξιφανης; or, LexiphaneS.

In this Dialogue, which in many parts of the original is very obscure,
Lucian is supposed to ridicule some of his contemporaries, whose writings
were stuffed with quaint and affected phraseS, obsolete words, and pompous
unmeaning expresfions, both in verse and prose, examples of which are
given from their'works. Gesner, one of the most learned commentators
on Lucian, observes with regard to these examples, that “ Frustra fuerit, fi
quis speret, ea fic poffe quacunque alia lingua reddi, ut quid auctor fibi
voluerit, aliquis Graece non doetus adsequatur.'’ That, it is impoffible so to

transsate this dialogne in any other language as to convey the author's mean·
ing to any but those who well understand Greek.

This, Ihope, may be a sufficient reason for not submitting it to the
English reader.

† Ερωτεςς or, the LoveS.

My female readers will perhaps confidet itas an injustice to them that I

ssiould pass over untranssated, a tra& of Lucian’s which bears so pretty a
name as the LoveS. They will, however, I doubt not, readily excuse me,
when I inform them that this piece is nothing more than a dispute between

ἒ the sexes concerning superiority3 but as this is a point which, at least in this
nation, has been long fince determined in favour of the ladies, it stands
in need of no farther discuffion : the Dialogue is therefore, for this, as well
as some other still more material reasons, which will occur to those who are
acquainted with the original, entirely omitted.

ss Ἐταιξικοι Διαλογοι; or, the Dialogues of the Harlots.

These Dialogues exhibit to us only such kind of conversation as we may
hear in the purlieus of Covent Garden3 lewd, dull, and insipid: befides,
that they were certainly not written by Lucian, andl am glad to find we
